# IronStone BOSS — Accounting design

Oct 28, 2026 — draft; reviewed against research-accounting.md, the reference apps and the other core designs ([review-core-apps.md](review-core-apps.md)); names the Mantle SECAs it keeps or conditions (§1.4) and adds bill intake and holds, match and costing policies, credit holds, budget commitments, base-currency posting (AC-19), the production posting rule and the external pages; brought in line with [impl-accounting.md](impl-accounting.md) §4 (the root and organization filters, the Mantle rule flags, the posting guard by source, effective-dated policies, payment terms, the pack invoice finalized at ship, and the customer and supplier pages as PASS apps in mr-pass)

IronStone Accounting serves finance teams, bookkeepers, collections staff and treasury. Its
sections are Receivables, Payables, Payments, Banking, General ledger, Period close, Fixed assets,
Inventory, Tax, Budgets, Reports and Settings. It completes invoice-to-cash and procure-to-pay and makes
stock, production and service transactions traceable to their financial effects. A small
business can use Accounting alone, including its contextual customer, supplier, product,
order, shipment, asset and return screens. This file is a design draft. Its Designed-in
mappings in the inventories are additive, and it makes no claim about implementation status.

**Inputs.** [research-accounting.md](research-accounting.md) §§1–18,
[research-crosscut.md](research-crosscut.md), [design-crosscut.md](design-crosscut.md),
[initial-design.md](initial-design.md), [style-guide.md](style-guide.md),
[design-doc-guide.md](design-doc-guide.md), [design-projects.md](design-projects.md),
[design-drawers-commons.md](design-drawers-commons.md), [ss-inventory.md](ss-inventory.md),
[usl-inventory.md](usl-inventory.md), and current Mantle and SimpleScreens source.

**Source paths.** `Accounting/...`, `Party/...` and `Asset/...` baseline references mean
`runtime/component/mr-marble/screen/SimpleScreens/` paths; inventory rows use their basename.
Mantle source is `runtime/component/mr-mantle/{entity,service/mantle}/`. Third-party paths are
relative to the named checkout beneath `~/work/moquiwork/3p_other`: Odoo uses the bundle root
(`odoo/addons/...`), Carbon `carbon/`, ERPNext `frappe/erpnext/`, Akaunting `akaunting/`,
Dolibarr `dolibarr/`. Research records additional references; this design cites the chosen
pattern per screen. Reference behavior is translated into BOSS/Mantle concepts, not copied code.

## 1. Shell

Root `screen/Accounting.xml`, mounted as `Accounting`, uses `BOSS_ACCOUNTING` as its root user
group and artifact group, and icon
`sym_o_account_balance`. The root already exists with placeholder sections; this file specifies
their replacement. It retains `mantle.party.PartyServices.setup#UserOrganizationInfo`, the
shared Chatter/RecordFiles mounts and existing shell. Selecting an organization changes all
queries and new-document defaults; supplied IDs are still checked against authenticated scope.

**Organization filters** (impl-accounting §4; impl-drawers-commons §4). The §1.1 groups take
`MANTLE_USER_ORG` and `MANTLE_PRIVATE_CONTACT`, so a user works within their own organizations.
`BOSS_ACCOUNTING_ADMIN` has all authz on the root, with `MANTLE_ACTIVE_ORG` and
`MANTLE_PRIVATE_CONTACT`: every organization until one is made active. Proposed
`ironstone.accounting.AccessServices` checks every supplied organization and record. The records
no entity filter covers (InvoiceItem, PaymentApplication, AcctgTransEntry, GlAccountOrganization,
PaymentMethod, PaymentMethodTrans, Budget, TaxStatement, Asset) are read only through services
that check their parent's organization, and `GlAccount` stays global.

The two external pages this file owns are not BOSS screens. Public-facing applications are in
mr-pass and internal ones in mr-boss, so they are pages of two PASS apps: InvoicePay in Billing,
for customers, and SupplierBillUpload as BillUpload in Supplier, for suppliers, not
`screen/ServicePortal.xml` and `screen/SupplierPortal.xml` roots in BOSS (impl-accounting §4,
reversing D5 of [review-core-apps.md](review-core-apps.md) and crosscut §5's two roots). They
follow PASS's foundation (design-forum §1, §4, §5): public accounts hold only `ALL_USERS`, and a
customer or supplier contact reaches its records through Mantle's checks of its relationship and
of `ExternalAccessCapability`, never a UserGroup, so there are no BOSS portal groups. The pages
call only Mantle services, through PASS's facade, and need no `BOSS_ACCOUNTING` grant. A
single-record link is a page of the app that takes its token, checked by the proposed Mantle
`mantle.party.ExternalAccessServices.check#AccessToken`.

### 1.1 Roles and controls

The role labels below are proposed capabilities, not claims that all groups are seeded:
AR (receivables/collections), AP (bills), treasury (payment/bank operations), GL (journal/asset
books), tax, report reader, finance approver and finance admin. Map these to proposed
`BOSS_ACCOUNTING_AR`, `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_AP`, `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_TREASURY`,
`BOSS_ACCOUNTING_GL`, `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_TAX`, `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_READ`,
`BOSS_ACCOUNTING_APPROVE` and `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_ADMIN` business-capability groups. The root grant controls launcher access; shared services check these capabilities independently and do not require the Accounting app-root grant.
Each business mutation also requires record/organization access. One person may hold several
roles. Self-approval is one audit-logged `PartyAcctgPreference` field, off by default, which only
`BOSS_ACCOUNTING_ADMIN` sets. It covers every Accounting approval (bills, invoices, journal
entries, payment runs, write-offs), and a decision whose approver drafted the record is stamped
self-approved, for the audit and the approvals report (impl-accounting §4). External access
capabilities are distinct from employee app membership.

**Capability map.** The table maps each role label used in this file to its group and actions
(D22). Crosscut §1 holds the suite table of `BOSS_<APP>_<CAPABILITY>` groups; these groups are
its Accounting rows and proposed seed data for crosscut CX-ACCESS (AC-01).

| Label in this file | Group | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AR | `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_AR` | customer invoices and credits, receipt allocation, collections, dunning, statements, return credit |
| AP | `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_AP` | bills and supplier credits, bill intake, placing a bill hold, payable selection; includes the match operator |
| match operator | proposed `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_MATCH` | evaluate and apply a bill match (D4); the one match group for both apps: AP includes it, and buyers who match bills in Purchasing are given it |
| treasury | `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_TREASURY` | payments, gateway actions, refund payments, bank accounts and bank details, statements, reconciliation, internal transfers |
| GL | `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_GL` | journal entries, asset books, inventory valuation, production cost close preview |
| tax | `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_TAX` | tax statements and their outputs |
| report reader (financial-read) | `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_READ` | reports, and financial values on shared mounts |
| finance approver | `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_APPROVE` | bill approval, hold release, payment run approval, period close, cost close posting, receiptless credit |
| finance admin | `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_ADMIN` | settings, locks, setup and audited data repair, the self-approval setting; the app's admin group, with all authz on the root (§1) |
| credit manager | AR + APPROVE | customer credit policy and credit hold release |
| tax admin | TAX + ADMIN | tax authorities and rates |
| lease and period-run approver | APPROVE + GL | advanced period runs, leases, recognition and intercompany, in each affected organization |

The terms other files use map to the same groups. Customer Service "F" is AR (the credit) plus
TREASURY (the refund payment). Warehouse "financial-read" is READ. Crosscut "financial readers"
is READ, and its "GL/finance approver" is GL plus APPROVE. Purchasing's "separate finance grant"
is APPROVE. The person who places a hold cannot release it.

Posting authority never follows from a visible tab. All invoice, payment, settlement, stock-value
and period mutations use guarded service adapters with current permission, status, balance,
lock-date and idempotency checks. The existing Mantle services remain reusable primitives; the
new guards are requirements, not assertions about their current enforcement. Posted amounts
are corrected by linked reversing/adjusting entries. Partial payment and overdue are derived
conditions from applications and due dates, not free-edit status choices.

The lock, period and idempotency guard runs inside Mantle `mantle.ledger.LedgerServices.post#AcctgTrans`.
That service is the one choke point for direct posting and for every auto-post SECA (AC-06).
Every Mantle mutator a form names below is called via the guarded transition, which adds the
AC-02 status, balance and hold checks before the primitive runs. Examples are `apply#InvoicePayment`,
`close#FinancialTimePeriod`, `deposit#FinancialAccount` and `create#PaymentMethodTrans`. The
BOSS_ACCOUNTING_* groups get no artifact authorization for `unpost#AcctgTrans`,
`update#AcctgTransPosted`, the `repost#*` services or the Mantle REST mutators. Only the
finance-admin data-repair actions (§19) reach a raw rewrite service.

A guard failure is split by source (impl-accounting §4). A finance user's direct post (a manual
entry, an invoice or payment post, a batch line) is refused with the reason. An automatic post
from an operational event (a receipt, issue, shipment or production fact) goes to the error
journal with the failed guard named; PostingDefaults' MissingMappings and error-journal list and
Today show it, and close refuses a period that still holds one (§9). An auto-poster that finds no
account records a failure, not `AtrSuccess`. A missing mapping is never sent to a silent suspense
account.

A bulk selection reports success/error per independent document or supplier payment. A single
financial transaction, application set, paired transfer, or document-and-ledger posting is atomic.
Unknown provider outcomes remain pending until reconciled; retry does not create a new payment.
Crosscut §4 supplies the common receipt/matching, return/refund and costing rules.

### 1.2 Menu and landing page

The menu shows only authorized areas and their two-level entries. Detail, wizard and external
screens are reached from the listed entry screens; §2 enumerates them all.

- Home — `Home`.
- Receivables — `Invoices`, `ReceivablesWorkbench`, `Collections`, `Dunning`, `Statements`,
  `RecurringInvoices`, `BillingQueue`.
- Payables — `Bills`, `PayablesWorkbench`, `PaymentRuns`, `ExpensePosting`, `LandedCosts`.
- Payments — `Payments`, `GatewayTransactions`.
- Banking — `BankAccounts`, `StatementImport`, `Reconciliations`, `UnmatchedTransactions`, `BankRules`
  (with treasury, so not under Settings; impl-accounting §4), `FinancialAccounts`.
- General ledger — `ChartOfAccounts`, `JournalEntries`, `TransactionEntries`, `JournalBatches`,
  `JournalTemplates`.
- Period close — `Periods`, `PeriodLocks`, `PeriodRuns`; `Leases`, `RevenueRecognition` and
  `Intercompany` appear when their later capabilities are enabled.
- Fixed assets — `FixedAssets`, `AssetClasses`.
- Inventory — `InventoryValuation`, `ProductionCostClose` (paths under `Accounting/Inventory/`).
- Tax — `TaxAuthorities`, `TaxRates`, `TaxStatements`; later `ElectronicInvoices`.
- Budgets — `Budgets`, `BudgetControls`; the Budget variance entry opens `BudgetVariance` in Reports.
- Reports — `Reports` with the named report screens of §13.
- Approvals — `Approvals`, the Commons Notifications mount filtered by Accounting's approval topics.
- Settings — `Settings`, `Setup`, `AccountingPreferences`, `PostingDefaults`, `PaymentTerms`,
  `Currencies`, `PaymentMethods`, `CollectionPolicies`, `DocumentSettings`,
  `MatchPolicies`, `CostingPolicies`.

Home contains AR due/overdue, AP due, cash by bank/currency, unmatched statement and unposted
counts; AR/AP aging; GL/subledger tie-out; bills/payment runs needing review; bills on hold;
production runs awaiting cost close; collection activities due; and setup blockers. Every
number links to the same authorized filtered rows.
Base-currency totals show their conversion date/rate basis; document-currency totals are grouped,
not summed across currencies without conversion. Until AC-19 ships, an organization finalizes
and posts only documents in its base currency (D18).

### 1.3 Shell providers, rendering and scope

Palette providers find invoices, payments, parties, accounts and journal entries within the
current organization's permissions. Quick create contributes invoice, bill, payment and draft
journal entry. Today contributes collection follow-ups, due finance approvals and automatic
postings sent to the error journal (§1.1); notification
topics carry bill holds, payment-run failures, statement import results, close blockers,
recurring-generation failures, credit holds and production cost review requests. The approval
topics are listed under [Approvals](#approvals-context-passed). Source documents remain authoritative; badges link to them.
Keyboard shortcuts use the shell registry and per-screen scope, never replace global keys.

All screens in this design use XML, including tree, split lists and wizards, so their ordinary
terminal rendering is retained. On terminal, split reconciliation panes become sequential
statement/candidate lists with the same selection and confirmation actions; matrix entry uses
row/period forms. A later custom rendering must add a terminal twin before replacing these.
Desktop is primary; customer invoice viewing/payment and supplier bill submission work at phone
width. Those two are PASS pages: server-rendered HTML with qvue enhancement, at 390 px and on the
desktop, and no terminal UI, which PASS does not have yet (impl-accounting §2). Preview/post pairs retain server operation identity across navigation or interrupted requests.

`parity` covers existing baseline behavior; `new` completes the first usable finance flows;
`later` covers advanced runs, electronic invoicing and other explicitly named extensions.
New tax services and new posting guards are release prerequisites, not empty menu placeholders.
Every service prefixed `ironstone.accounting` below is **proposed**. `entity` denotes ordinary
access-controlled reads/configuration CRUD; it never authorizes raw financial-state writes.

### 1.4 Existing automation

These Mantle SECAs and ServiceJobs already run on paths this file designs (D1). Each row says
whether the design keeps it, runs it only under a condition, or replaces it. Crosscut §1.3 holds
the suite register.

Each Mantle rule change below, and each new refusal in a Mantle service, is how Mantle behaves
from then on. Only a change that would break Mantle's flow specs stays behind its own flag, off by
default, listed with its reason in impl-accounting §4 (F27): today `postingGuardEnabled`, the
posting guard; D2's receipt billing, D3's pack invoice and D11's return settlement change what
those specs assert and get flags when built. A flag is an audit-logged field of
`PartyAcctgPreference`, inherited as its other fields are, with a neutral name, since Mantle never
names BOSS. BOSS's demo organization turns the flags on; the organizations Mantle's specs use
leave them off.

| SECA or job | Runs on | This design | Where |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ShipmentIncomingDeliveredCreateInvoices` | an incoming Shipment reaching ShipDelivered; calls `mantle.account.InvoiceServices.create#PurchaseShipmentInvoices` | conditioned (D2, behind its flag `PartyAcctgPreference.receiptInvoiceSelfBilledOnly`, built in P6): it runs only for a supplier whose proposed `SupplierProfile.selfBillingIndicator` is set, and then bills accepted, released quantity only (proposed `acceptedOnly` parameter); it never bills a service line | [Bills](#bills); ShipmentDetail |
| `ShipmentOutgoingPackedCreateInvoices` | an outgoing Shipment reaching ShipPacked; calls `create#SalesShipmentInvoices` | conditioned (D3, behind its flag): it creates the sales invoice InvoiceInProcess without applying payments, and a proposed ShipShipped SECA finalizes it, posting it, applying captured payments and sending it; proposed `release#ShipmentDraftInvoice` reopens it between pack and ship. With the flag off Mantle finalizes at pack as before | OrderDetail; ShipmentDetail |
| `InvoiceFinalizedSendEmail` | an Invoice moving from InvoiceInProcess to InvoiceFinalized; calls `send#InvoiceStoreEmail` | conditioned: it skips an invoice version that proposed `send#Invoice` has already sent, so a store invoice is not sent twice | Invoices; InvoiceDetail |
| `InvoiceApplyForPayments`, `PaymentApplyForInvoice` | an Invoice approved or finalized, or a Payment delivered; apply a payment that names `forInvoiceId` | conditioned (no flag; built in P6): the hold guard inside Mantle, where a payment is applied to a payable invoice, refuses a payable with an open InvoiceHold; the services the SECAs call (`apply#PaymentForInvoice`, `apply#InvoiceForPayments`) leave a held bill's payment unapplied with a `PAYMENT_HELD` warning, and releasing the last hold of an approved bill applies it | Bills; PaymentDetail |
| `OrderPlacedAutoApprove` | an OrderHeader reaching OrderPlaced; calls `autoApprove#Order` | conditioned (D7): proposed `CreditServices.evaluate#OrderCredit` runs as a SECA on `mantle.order.OrderInfoServices.check#OrderPreApprove` and adds an approve warning; a Hold result places an OrderHold with reason Credit | OrderDetail; Customer360 |
| `ReturnApprovedProcess` | a ReturnHeader reaching ReturnApproved; calls `create#ReturnShipment` and `process#ReturnItemResponses` | conditioned (D11, behind its flag): it keeps only `create#ReturnShipment`; responses are settled by the proposed `settle#Return` | ReturnDetail |
| `ShipmentDeliveredReturnReceive`, `ReturnReceivedProcess` | a return Shipment delivered; a ReturnHeader reaching ReturnReceived | replaced (D11) by Warehouse's proposed `receive#ReturnItems`, which processes no responses | ReturnDetail |
| `InvoiceGlPost`, `PaymentGlPost`, `PaymentApplicationGlPost`, `AssetReceiptGlPost`, `AssetIssuanceGlPost`, `AssetDetailPhysicalVarianceGlPost` and the other auto-post SECAs of `AccountingLedger.secas.xml` | document and stock changes | kept; each posts through `post#AcctgTrans`, where the AC-06 guard runs, and a guard failure is refused or goes to the error journal by its source (§1.1); AC-19 adds base-currency conversion | §1.1; AC-06 |
| `AssetIssuanceGlRePost` | any update of an AssetIssuance; calls `repost#AssetIssuance`, which unposts and deletes the posted transaction | replaced (AC-06): the repost writes a dated reversing delta in an open period; BOSS never updates or cancels a posted production issuance | ProductionCostClose |
| ServiceJob `create_RecurringOrders` | nightly; clones recurring orders and invoices those marked `recurAutoInvoice` | kept as a monitored job (D24); RecurringInvoices shows its last result | RecurringInvoices |
| ServiceJob `send_SalesInvoicePastDueEmails` | weekly; paused | kept paused; Dunning is the only scheduled reminder sender, and Setup readiness flags the job if someone unpauses it | Dunning; Setup |

## 2. Screens

One row per screen. Reused rows are fully defined by their canonical owner and have only a
context block here. The screen table's short record names resolve to Mantle unless marked
proposed; framework currency units are `moqui.basic.Uom` and `moqui.basic.UomConversion`.

**Actions:** Tabs Draft, Unpaid, Overdue, Credits, All use derived balances. New opens InvoiceDetail. Send/print/export are selected-row operations; each invoice failure is named and the rest continue.

Send calls proposed `send#Invoice` for each invoice, with or without a ProductStore. It renders the
invoice as sent and its attachments, and stores the PDF as the invoice's content stamped with its
time (impl-accounting §4). It issues the InvoicePay link through
proposed `mantle.account.PortalServices.issue#InvoiceAccess`: the Billing app's InvoicePay page
of the organization's PASS site, taking its token. It sends through
`mantle.party.CommunicationServices.send#EmailDraft` and records the outcome per recipient.
Projects' `ironstone.projects.BillingServices.send#Invoice` calls it for project invoices. The
Mantle SECA `InvoiceFinalizedSendEmail` skips an invoice version already sent this way (§1.4).

### InvoiceDetail (Context passed)

**Context passed.** Mount `Accounting/Receivables/InvoiceDetail` using InvoiceDetail, crosscut §3.16. Mount `Shared/InvoiceDetail` with receivables direction and organization fixed. Tabs: Overview, Items/taxes, Payments/credits, Orders, Shipments, Budget details, GL, Files, Chatter, History. AR edits drafts, sends and applies eligible receipts. Finalize, reverse and credit need AR, plus finance approver where the organization's policy requires approval. Preserve Projects time/milestone links and its narrower client view. Actions use the shared contract, including `mantle.account.InvoiceServices.get#InvoiceDisplayInfo`, `create#InvoiceCreditMemo`, `reverse#Invoice` and `mantle.account.PaymentServices.apply#InvoiceToInvoice`.

Every state change (approve, finalize, resume, cancel) goes through proposed `ironstone.accounting.InvoiceServices.change#InvoiceState`, the single state guard (D6). Projects' `ironstone.projects.BillingServices.update#InvoiceStatus` calls it, so the Projects labels do not change. InvoiceSend uses proposed `send#Invoice` ([Invoices](#invoices)). A finalized invoice is not edited; it is corrected through a credit memo or, after shipment, a return (impl-accounting §4, the pack invoice). Until AC-19 ships, finalizing an invoice whose currency differs from the organization's base currency is refused.

**Needs:** AC-02; AC-08; AC-11; AC-19.

**Actions:** Preview then confirm allocation atomically per party/currency set. Lock balances and re-read before applying; stale previews refresh. Discount/write-off/FX requires the proposed settlement adapter and explicit accounts, never a silently reduced balance. A realized exchange difference is booked by `mantle.ledger.PaymentAutoPostServices.post#PaymentApplication` to `GatForExGain` or `GatForExLoss` once AC-19 ships; until then every document is in the organization's base currency (D18).

**Actions:** Open Customer360, record contact, schedule follow-up, record/dispute promise, preview a reminder. Promises reconcile against qualifying payments; they never mark an invoice paid. A disputed invoice is excluded from automatic reminder runs until reviewed.

**Actions:** Generate preview, inspect a letter, confirm Send. Idempotency is per customer/invoice-set/level/run; one recipient failure does not restart successful sends. Fees and interest are later, require a separate reviewed invoice/adjustment, and are never implicit email side effects. Dunning runs are the only scheduled reminder sender. Mantle's weekly `send_SalesInvoicePastDueEmails` job stays paused, and Setup readiness flags it if someone unpauses it (§1.4).

**Actions:** Preview is mandatory before a send. A statement is the customer's open items today, aged as of the chosen date (`mantle.account.CollectionServices.get#Statements`); there is no opening balance and no stored snapshot. A send goes through an EmailTemplate, and its EmailMessage rows are the record. Batch failures are per recipient.

| GeneratePreview | dialog | Preview the next billing period | schedule, period, invoice date, proration, amount, tax result | — | proposed `ironstone.accounting.RecurringServices.preview#Period` | ERPNext Subscription generation |

**Actions:** Preview, generate draft, pause/resume and inspect last result. Generation key is schedule+period; source changes create a revised schedule for future periods. Default produces drafts; opt-in auto-send still requires successful tax/credit/period validation.

The screen lists two sources (D24). Order-based recurring billing stays on the OrderHeader
recurrence, which is edited in OrderDetail's Recurrence form; the nightly `create_RecurringOrders`
job clones and invoices those orders, and RecurringOrders shows them read-only with its last
result. Proposed InvoiceSchedule serves only invoice-only cadences: rent, retainers and recurring
supplier bills.

**Navigation:** The receivables entry and Home queues link here; source identifiers open their Accounting detail mount or an authorized shared record. Back preserves find filters.

**Source:** research §4, §6; ERPNext Subscription; existing InvoiceTemplate and Subscription records; Mantle OrderHeader recurrence.

**Needs:** AC-09; AC-08.

### Customer360 (Context passed)

**Context passed.** Mount `Accounting/Receivables/Customer360` using Customer360, crosscut §3.2. Fix customer and organization. Tabs: Contact, Orders, Invoices/payments, Credit, Agreements, Activities, Files, as the crosscut Accounting row has them. Invoices/payments holds the crosscut CustomerAging list and CustomerFinancialSummary display, and its Statement action opens Statements with the customer fixed (crosscut additions R-XC-41 and R-XC-42). Show credit limit/currency/overdue threshold and its source policy. A credit manager edits the policy in the CustomerCredit form through proposed `ironstone.accounting.CreditServices.store#Policy`, and releases a credit hold with a reason through proposed `release#CreditHold`. The shared PaymentDetails, PartyIdentifications and TaxRegistrations forms show here (D26); PaymentDetails and TaxRegistrations are finance-gated, and bank details are masked. Customer Service readers get allowed balances/hold reason, not bank credentials. Activities and promises are the same ones Collections records, and they show here (D25). Source: Party/FinancialInfo and research §13.

**Needs:** AC-10; AC-11; AC-12.

### InvoicePay

**Physical definition.** InvoicePay is owned here and is a page of the PASS Billing app in
mr-pass (`screen/Billing.xml`, the `billing` mount), not a BOSS screen (§1; impl-accounting §4).
Billing is a `PublicSiteApp` with the organization as its target, under PASS's `Pass.xml`, with
its navigation, readiness and operator configuration on Forum's pattern (design-forum §1, §13).
A signed-in customer contact is a PASS public account, invited through a PASS invitation bound
to the app and the customer; redeeming it makes the relationship Mantle checks. The internal
Accounting launcher grant is not a customer-access requirement.
A single-invoice link is a page of the app that takes its token, checked by proposed
`mantle.party.ExternalAccessServices.check#AccessToken`. InvoiceSend issues the link
through proposed `mantle.account.PortalServices.issue#InvoiceAccess`. The page calls the authority
only through `pass.Facade.call#Operation`, locally or from a remote PASS frontend through Mantle's
PassApi, so every service it calls is Mantle's. `PortalServices` call the proposed
`check#AccessCapability` first; they keep no token or expiry rules of their own.

**Layout:** detail.

**Forms:**

| Form | Kind | Purpose | Highlighted fields | Widgets of note | Services | Derived from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PublicInvoice | display | Show the customer-approved document | number, issue/due date, lines, tax, total, paid, due | — | proposed `mantle.account.PortalServices.get#Invoice` | Akaunting signed invoice portal; Projects client invoice view |
| PayInvoice | single | Start hosted or tokenized payment | invoice, amount due, allowed payment method, payer confirmation, request identity | — | proposed `mantle.account.PortalServices.start#InvoicePayment` | Odoo payment portal; Frappe payments checkout |
| PaymentResult | display | Show confirmed payment or pending gateway result | attempt id, amount, gateway state, receipt, next action | — | proposed `mantle.account.PortalServices.get#PaymentResult` | Frappe payments success/failed/cancel pages |

**Actions:** The page is separate from the internal Accounting app grant: a public account holds only `ALL_USERS`, no BOSS group, and the page runs no Accounting always-actions. A record-scoped token or authenticated customer relationship grants view; a gateway-confirmed result grants payment settlement. The gateway's return comes back to a registered local path of the app. Redirect return parameters never mark paid. Keep pending visible and let retry resume the existing attempt.

**States:** Expired/revoked/foreign token returns unavailable without disclosing invoice existence. No Chatter, cost, internal time rates, bank secrets or unrelated party navigation.

**Navigation:** Open from the sent invoice link or an authenticated customer's permitted invoice
list. Return to that external origin or show the submission/payment receipt. Source links expose
only explicitly permitted customer records; this page does not open internal Accounting navigation.

**Source:** research §4, §7 and §16; Projects client isolation contract; crosscut §5; design-forum §1, §4, §5 and §13.1.

**Actions:** Create a draft and open InvoiceDetail/BillDetail. Preserve Projects approved timesheet and billing locks; an already billed entry cannot be selected twice. Accounting does not alter time approval. Mount remains available without Projects app grant when finance has the underlying project billing capability.

**Navigation:** The receivables entry and Home queues link here; source identifiers open their Accounting detail mount or an authorized shared record. Back preserves find filters.

**Actions:** Incoming, Review, Held, Approved, Due, Credits tabs. Upload creates a draft and preserves the original; extraction suggestions require review. Detect supplier/reference duplicates in organization scope. Approve only after matching policy passes or recorded release. Create from a PO or a receipt opens the InvoiceFromSource dialog on OrderDetail or ShipmentDetail (§14).

**Bill creation (D2).** Accounting owns bill intake. With D2's flag on (§1.4), a receipt creates no bill by default. The
Mantle SECA `ShipmentIncomingDeliveredCreateInvoices` runs only for a supplier whose proposed
`SupplierProfile.selfBillingIndicator` is set (finance sets it on Supplier360). For that
supplier it calls `create#PurchaseShipmentInvoices` with the proposed `acceptedOnly=true`
parameter. That bills accepted, released quantity at the PO price, skips the leftover line with no
asset, and excludes quantity under open inspection. It never bills a service line; a service or
subcontract bill comes only through the proposed `import#Bill` (D14). `import#Bill` is keyed by organization,
supplier and supplier invoice reference, or by shipmentId for a self-billed draft. A second bill
with the same key is refused and the earlier one is named. It takes an upload from AP intake, and
from a Purchasing buyer (`BOSS_PURCHASING_BUYER`) for a bill on a PO of an organization the
buyer belongs to; Purchasing's Bills mounts it (impl-accounting §4). For a self-billed receipt, an upload
attaches its evidence to the existing draft instead of creating a bill. Matching evaluates a
self-billed draft two-way, against the PO and the accepted receipt.

**Holds (D4).** AP places a hold with HoldInvoice, or with Place hold on BillDetail and
InvoiceMatch, through proposed `MatchServices.hold#Invoice`. Seeded hold reasons (proposed):
match exception, AP review, supplier dispute, bank-detail change. A finance approver who did not
place the hold releases it with the proposed `release#InvoiceHold`. Purchasing asks for a release through
proposed `MatchServices.request#HoldRelease`, which posts an Approvals item (topic
`BillHoldRelease`). A hold blocks every payment path, not only payment runs. The hold guard is
inside Mantle, at the one point where a payment is applied to a payable invoice, with no flag
(§1.4), and reads Mantle's own InvoiceHold (impl-accounting §4). PaymentRunDetail
execution, InvoiceSettlement's proposed `apply#Settlement` and payable
`mantle.account.PaymentServices.create#InvoicePayment` and `apply#InvoicePayment` meet the same
check and refuse a bill with an open InvoiceHold. A payment that Mantle applies by `forInvoiceId`
(the `PaymentApplyForInvoice` and `InvoiceApplyForPayments` SECAs) stays unapplied with a named
exception.

### BillDetail (Context passed)

**Context passed.** Mount `Accounting/Payables/BillDetail` using InvoiceDetail, crosscut §3.16. Mount Shared/InvoiceDetail with payable direction. Tabs: Overview, Items/taxes, Match, Payments, Orders, Shipments, Budget details, GL, source document, Chatter, History. Incoming → Received → Approved → Payment Sent retains Mantle status IDs. Separate invoice hold from approval state and show reason/release date. Payment never bypasses hold. Match opens InvoiceMatch; supplier return credit links ReturnDetail. A match operator (AP, or a Purchasing buyer granted the capability) applies the match through proposed `MatchServices.apply#InvoiceMatch` (D4). Place hold opens the HoldInvoice dialog (`hold#Invoice`, AP). Only a finance approver releases a hold (`release#InvoiceHold`) and approves the bill, through proposed `ironstone.accounting.InvoiceServices.approve#Payable`. Purchasing applies matching with the match-operator capability and proposes corrections. State changes go through `InvoiceServices.change#InvoiceState` (D6). Approval converts the PO's budget commitment to actual through proposed `BudgetServices.convert#Commitment` (D10). Source: research §6 and Accounting/EditInvoice.

**Needs:** AC-02; AC-03; AC-08; AC-14.

### InvoiceMatch (Context passed)

**Context passed.** Mount `Accounting/Payables/InvoiceMatch` using InvoiceMatch, crosscut §3.22. Fix invoice and organization. Display bill lines alongside PO and accepted receipt quantities, prior billed/credited quantities, price/UOM/currency/tax and tolerance. A match operator (AP or buyer) applies the match; only finance releases exceptions with a reason and approves; buyers explain or correct their purchasing records. Place hold is offered here as on BillDetail. Retain quantity allocation by source line, and rerun validation on source changes. Mount also from BillDetail. No match action fabricates receipt or changes stock. Source: Odoo purchase_bill_line_match and ERPNext Purchase Invoice links.

Apply writes or updates Mantle `OrderItemBilling` (order item, invoice item, AssetReceipt, shipment, quantity, amount) in the same transaction, so "already billed", return eligibility and `apply#InvoiceItemToOrder` read the match. InvoiceMatchLine keeps the snapshot, tolerance and the policy row it applied; unapply reverses both. Quantity held under open inspection is excluded, as read from proposed `mantle.product.QualityServices.get#SourceInspectionStatus` (D21). A service line matches against Purchasing's acceptance (proposed `ironstone.purchasing.ReceiptServices.accept#ServiceItem`), not a receipt. Tolerances, bill basis and receipt-required come from [MatchPolicies](#matchpolicies). Proposed `MatchServices.queue#MatchReevaluation` marks results stale. It runs from the AssetReceipt and InvoiceItem EECAs, from `dispose#Inspection`, from Purchasing's proposed `apply#PurchaseRevision` and from `settle#Return`. A background job evaluates the queue and names each bill's result. No hold is released automatically. A drop-ship bill matches against the shipped drop-ship delivery, which Purchasing adds to `evaluate#InvoiceMatch` as evidence (impl-purchasing §4).

**Needs:** AC-03.

### LandedCosts

Accounting owns landed-cost allocation (R-ACC-10). It is in the first release (decided Oct 28,
2026; crosscut §8); Purchasing's InvoiceDetail offers "Allocate to receipts" as a link here.

**Layout:** task; charge lines on the left, target receipt lines on the right, the allocation
preview below.

**Forms:**

| PostLandedCost | dialog | Post the reviewed allocation | previewId/version, basis, accounting date, reason, operation key | explicit confirmation | proposed `ironstone.accounting.AssetBookServices.post#LandedCost` | ERPNext Landed Cost Voucher submit |

**Actions:** Preview, then post. On post, the share for assets still on hand becomes a value-only
adjustment to their cost with ledger links, and the share already issued goes to COGS or
production variance. Each allocation is a proposed `mantle.account.invoice.LandedCostAllocation`
row (source invoice item, AssetReceipt and shipment, basis, amount, currency, posting identity).
A charge line is allocated at most once; a correction reverses and posts again in an open period.
Warehouse InventoryValuation reads the adjusted value.

### Supplier360 (Context passed)

**Context passed.** Mount `Accounting/Payables/Supplier360` using Supplier360, crosscut §3.3. As built (impl-accounting P6, F135), Accounting's supplier context is its own 360 screen with the tabs Bills and payments, Agreements and terms and Finance details, since a shared screen's tabs cannot differ by mount; Products' `Shared/Supplier360` keeps the buying context. Fix supplier and organization. Tabs: Contact, Bills/payments, Agreements/terms, Orders, Receipts, Activities, as the crosscut Accounting row has them; supplier credits and return credits show inside Bills/payments. Show held and unmatched totals separately from payable balances. Supplier price edits require sourcing authority. Existing party financial forms feed open items.

Supplier default payment terms live only on the proposed `SupplierProfile.settlementTermId` (R-ACC-16). SupplierProfile is effective-dated by organization and supplier (`fromDate`, `thruDate`); `settlementTermId` and `selfBillingIndicator` are its only finance fields, both audit-logged, and the rest of the profile is Purchasing's (impl-accounting §4). Finance edits them on Agreements/terms through Purchasing's proposed `ironstone.purchasing.SupplierServices.store#SupplierProfile`, which checks a finance capability for the terms fields. AC-02 extends the term precedence of `mantle.account.InvoiceServices.create#Invoice` to agreement term, then SupplierProfile, then PartyAcctgPreference. Finance also sets the proposed `SupplierProfile.selfBillingIndicator` there (D2). The shared PaymentDetails, PartyIdentifications and TaxRegistrations forms show here (D26). PaymentDetails writes through `mantle.account.PaymentMethodServices.create#BankAccount` and `update#BankAccount` behind the finance guard (treasury), masked and audited. A bank-detail change voids any pending payment-run approval for the supplier, and AP may place a bank-detail-change hold. Activities show here as on Customer360 (D25).

**Needs:** AC-02; AC-03; AC-12.

### SupplierBillUpload

**Physical definition.** SupplierBillUpload is owned here and is the BillUpload page of the PASS
Supplier app in mr-pass (`screen/Supplier.xml`, the `supplier` mount), not a BOSS screen (§1;
impl-accounting §4). Supplier is a `PublicSiteApp` on InvoicePay's pattern; Purchasing adds its
home, QuoteResponse and OrderAcknowledgement (impl-purchasing §4). Verified supplier/organization
scope and source revision govern it; it requires no BOSS grant and runs no app-root
always-actions. A signed-in supplier contact is a PASS public account invited for the supplier,
with no UserGroup. The PO's link opens BillUpload for that PO: AP issues its capability from
OrderDetail through proposed `mantle.party.ExternalAccessServices.create#AccessCapability`, and
Purchasing's `send#PurchaseOrder` later issues one capability for BillUpload and
OrderAcknowledgement. The link is a page of the app taking its token, checked by proposed
`check#AccessToken`, not a `/po/<token>` route. The proposed
`mantle.account.PortalServices.submit#SupplierBill` calls `check#AccessCapability` first, takes its
files through PASS's media staging and scanning, and makes the incoming draft through the Mantle
core of `import#Bill`.

**Layout:** wizard.

| SubmissionReceipt | display | Confirm receipt without approval | submission id, received time, draft invoice reference, processing state | — | proposed `mantle.account.PortalServices.get#Submission` | Odoo inbound bill capture |

**Actions:** Authorize supplier relationship/record-scoped invitation before showing PO choices. Duplicate uploads/reference repeats return the earlier submission. An accepted file creates an InvoiceIncoming bill for AP review through `import#Bill`, under the same key (D2). When a self-billed draft already exists for that receipt, the file attaches to the draft instead. It never creates an approved payable.

**Navigation:** Open from a verified supplier invitation, the PO's link or the supplier's permitted PO page.
Back returns to that external page, and the receipt shows only this submission's permitted status.
Internal AP users separately open the resulting incoming bill from their own authorized worklist.

Validate requires treasury capability; no list edit can set a settled state without payment evidence. An outgoing payment applied to a bill with an open hold is refused ([Bills](#bills)).

Transfer between accounts (R-ACC-17) is offered here and on BankAccountDetail. It creates one delivered
`PtInternalTransfer` Payment from the organization to itself, `paymentMethodId` the source method and
`toPaymentMethodId` the destination, through `create#Payment`. Its `post#Payment` posts the outgoing and the incoming
transaction through the transit account of `PaymentTypeGlAccount`, each against its own method's cash account, so
each side reconciles on its own statement. A fee is its own `PtDisbursement` payment to an outside party, posted to
the chosen expense account (`overrideTypeGlAccountId`) and pointing at its transfer (`feeForPaymentId`). All of it
commits or none does.

**Actions:** Confirm delivered/cleared evidence through guarded transition adapter, post via mantle.ledger.PaymentAutoPostServices.post#Payment, reverse through mantle.ledger.PaymentAutoPostServices.revert#PaymentPost, void via mantle.account.PaymentServices.void#Payment. Posted corrections preserve original links. Refund check locks original refundable balance; partial refunds cumulative. Payment-date changes call mantle.account.PaymentServices.set#PaymentDate under lock/period controls. For a payable, `apply#InvoicePayment` runs inside the hold guard and refuses a bill with an open InvoiceHold (D4). A refund that an order change between pack and ship needs is created by proposed `SettlementServices.refund#OrderPayment` (D3) and shows here linked to the original payment.

Reconcile, Unreconcile and No reconcile stay as row actions here, independent of a reconciliation
session, so the baseline manual reconciliation keeps parity even if ReconciliationDetail slips
(R-ACC-25). A deposit slip (R-ACC-33) groups receipts of one bank account and currency under one
proposed `mantle.account.payment.PaymentDeposit` (deposit, bank payment method, date, reference,
total), linked from each grouped Payment by the proposed `Payment.paymentDepositId`. The single

**Actions:** Post requires balanced lines, complete accounts, open period and authorized organization. Delete only drafts. Posted entries are read-only; correction creates linked reversal and a new draft. The old UpdateAcctgTransPosted and unpost shortcuts are deliberately not exposed for financial changes; metadata corrections use an audited limited adapter.

**Sections and tabs:** Header, balanced lines with totals, source documents, Files, audit. The existing ledger dimensions are few (R-ACC-11); the first release adds facility and cost centre (AC-22). A line carries product and asset (`AcctgTransEntry.productId`, `AcctgTransEntry.assetId`). The header carries the other party and the work effort (`AcctgTrans.otherPartyId`, `AcctgTrans.workEffortId`). Each line also carries the proposed facility and cost centre, which its GL account may require (AC-22). Files lists attachments through the shared RecordFiles over the proposed `mantle.ledger.transaction.AcctgTransContent` (AC-21), registered in `mantle.party.CommunicationServices.get#RecordLinkInfo` (D25).

**Actions:** Inspect transactions, validate, then post via proposed mantle.ledger.JournalServices.post#Batch with confirmation and closed-period checks. Each transaction is atomic; independent constituent failures are named and the others continue. The batch remains open with a derived partial result until all eligible transactions succeed. Existing mantle.ledger.LedgerServices.post#GlJournal returns on a raised error, but a transaction diverted to the error journal raises none and is counted as posted, and `closeJournal` marks the journal posted regardless (impl-accounting F17); it is not used for this batch behavior.

**Actions:** Refresh checklist after any correction. Close locks/revalidates period and blockers, posts closing entries, computes and stores the period's GlAccountOrgTimePeriod summary rows (creating any that are missing, which the reports read; §13) and records snapshot atomically; failed close leaves period open with named blockers. Reopen is audited and never erases the old close record. Deep-link to depreciation, tax and reconciliation; no automatic hidden repairs.

CloseChecks also lists these rows, each linked to the screen that resolves it:

- Automatic postings sent to the error journal, each with its failed guard or missing account named (§1.1; PostingDefaults); close refuses a period that still holds one.
- Production runs awaiting cost close, from proposed `ProductionCostServices.find#CostCloseQueue` (ProductionCostClose).
- Stock movements that posted nothing: AssetReceipt and AssetIssuance rows whose `acctgTransResultEnumId` is `AtrNoAcquireCost` or `AtrNoAcctgPreference`, zero-cost receipts, and open WIP by run (InventoryValuation).
- Open WIP on completed `WepPickAssembly` kit efforts and `WepAssembling` repack efforts, which must be zero (Warehouse WH-POST passes the kit's acquire cost).
- Uninvoiced receipts against the `GatUninvoicedShpmntRcpts` (GRNI) clearing balance, linked to Purchasing MatchExceptions "received, not billed".
- Approved physical counts not yet posted, and count deltas that Mantle's variance posting skipped because the asset already has a transaction for that PhysicalInventory (Warehouse's proposed `post#Count`).

**Actions:** A hard/all period close remains non-bypassable; exceptions only relax the specified soft lock and never TimePeriod.isClosed. A scope goes by the transaction's source document (impl-accounting §4). Sales: transactions whose invoice the organization issued (sales invoices, customer credits and returns, their adjustments). Purchases: those whose invoice it received. Tax: any transaction with an entry on a `GatTax` account, and `AttTaxDue` and `AttTaxInvoice`. All: every transaction, so payments, stock, depreciation and manual entries fall under it only. A hard lock takes no exception. Preview impacted records before save; scope and expiry are checked server-side on every posting, refund, reversal and backdated change.

## 10. Fixed assets and inventory

This section holds the Fixed assets menu area and the Inventory menu area (R-ACC-26).
InventoryValuation and ProductionCostClose live under `Accounting/Inventory/`, not under

### EquipmentDetail (Context passed)

**Context passed.** Mount `Accounting/FixedAssets/EquipmentDetail` using EquipmentDetail, crosscut §3.10. Fix asset and organization. Panes: Equipment identity, Book, source/history, with the facility accounting context, as the crosscut Accounting row has them; the depreciation schedule and its GL links sit inside Book. Accounting capitalizes, adjusts, disposes or sells and reverses through the dialogs below; Maintenance/Manufacturing/Warehouse contexts show permitted net-book summaries without these actions. Asset classes supply defaults, not mutable historical policy. Disposal revalidates active usage/stock links, records proceeds and writes linked GL entries; it does not delete the asset.

The Book pane adds these dialogs (R-ACC-08). Mantle has no disposal service, so all four book
services are proposed. Each writes a proposed `AssetBookEvent` (AC-07) with its ledger links.

### AssetClasses

**Layout:** settings.

**Forms:**

**Actions:** A change ends the current row (`thruDate`) and starts the next (`fromDate`); its key fields are audit-logged (impl-accounting §4). Already capitalized assets retain their adopted book basis. Accounts must be valid for the selected organization.

**Actions:** Calculate first. Every asset-period posts at most once; lock it at posting. Each independent asset reports errors without aborting the rest, but the asset depreciation row and its journal entry commit together. Reverse creates linked correcting entries and marks the run/result reversed.

### InventoryValuation

**Physical definition.** Proposed `screen/Shared/InventoryValuation.xml`, owned here, is
mounted at the Accounting route and `Warehouse/Reports/InventoryValuation`. Warehouse fixes
its authorized facility scope; financial-read exposes values, and revaluation controls require
the separate finance mutation capability. Neither mount requires the other app's launcher grant.

**Layout:** report.

**Forms:**

| Form | Kind | Purpose | Highlighted fields | Widgets of note | Services | Derived from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ValuationOptions | find | Choose valuation snapshot | organization, facility, product, lot, as-of date, costing method | — | — | Accounting/Reports/AssetValuation |
| ValuationRows | list, read | Set stock value beside the ledger and show the difference | product/asset, quantity, current unit cost, value, inventory GL, WIP, difference | — | proposed `ironstone.accounting.ReportServices.run#InventoryValuation` over the `AssetValuationSummary` view | Accounting/Reports/AssetValuation AssetValuationSummary |
| ValuationExceptions | list, read | Show stock movements that posted nothing or went to the error journal, and WIP by run | receipt or issuance, product, quantity, posting result (`AtrNoAcquireCost`, `AtrNoAcctgPreference`, zero-cost receipt, error journal), production run, open WIP | links to the source movement and the run | same proposed `run#InventoryValuation` result | Mantle `acctgTransResultEnumId` on AssetReceipt and AssetIssuance |

| PostRevaluation | dialog | Post the reviewed revaluation | previewId/version, effective date, reason, operation key; totals read-only | explicit confirmation; resulting ledger links | proposed `ironstone.accounting.AssetBookServices.post#Revaluation` | ERPNext stock revaluation submit; new posting controls specified here |
| CostDataRepair | dialog | Rewrite a product's asset acquire costs as audited data repair | product, new acquire cost, affected assets, reason, open-period check result, operation key | finance admin only; warning that it rewrites posted history | `mantle.product.AssetServices.update#ProductAcquireCost` | Asset/FindAsset UpdateProductCost |

**Actions:** Drill into AssetReceipt/AssetIssuance and ledger sources. Revalue requires a reviewed run and financial authority; cost edits in Products never alter posted values automatically. Quantity remains owned by stock postings.

Revaluation has a preview and a post step (R-ACC-02); PostRevaluation's listed fields are its full field list. It posts value-only
adjustments with ledger links in an open period, and never calls `update#ProductAcquireCost` on
posted receipts. Products' "Request revaluation" opens ValuationAdjustment with the
`productStandardCostId` of the approved estimate, an effective-dated row (impl-products §4). CostDataRepair is the baseline
UpdateProductCost, kept only as a finance-admin data-repair action with audit and an open-period
check. ValuationExceptions shows the receipts and issues that posted nothing, so a missing cost
basis or posting preference is found before close.

`AssetValuationSummary` values on-hand quantity at each asset's current cost, not from the GL, so
`run#InventoryValuation` sets that value beside the inventory and WIP account balances and shows
the difference. ValuationExceptions lists what explains it: the `AtrNoAcquireCost` and
`AtrNoAcctgPreference` movements, zero-cost receipts (which post zero), and movements whose
posting went to the error journal (impl-accounting F40).

**Navigation:** The inventory entry, CloseChecks and Home queues link here; source identifiers open their Accounting detail mount or an authorized shared record. Back preserves find filters.

**Needs:** AC-07; AC-12.

### ProductionCostClose

**Physical definition.** Proposed `screen/Shared/ProductionCostClose.xml`, owned here, is
mounted at `Accounting/Inventory/ProductionCostClose` and within Manufacturing's run context. Both mounts
apply the same financial capability, organization, period and source-revision checks.

**Layout:** task; run identity and operational/quality status above cost evidence, output
allocation and proposed ledger entries. InventoryValuation, close-check exceptions and
Manufacturing's ProductionCosts link here. Terminal users review the same tables and numbered
Preview/Approve/Post actions; narrow layouts stack the three panes.

**Forms:**

| Form | Kind | Purpose | Highlighted fields | Widgets of note | Services | Derived from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CostCloseScope | single | Select the run and posting basis | organizationPartyId, workEffortId, accountingDate, allocationPolicyId (the [CostingPolicies](#costingpolicies) row effective on the accounting date), reason; source/estimate version read-only | run lookup from the cost close queue, period warning | proposed `ironstone.accounting.ProductionCostServices.preview#CostClose`; proposed `ironstone.accounting.ProductionCostServices.find#CostCloseQueue` | Manufacturing ProductionCosts; Carbon JobEstimatesVsActuals; new close controls specified here |
| CostEvidence | list, read | Reconcile actual facts and prior allocations | event ID/type, source ID/line, operation/snapshot line, quantity/UOM, currency, frozen rate, amount, prior allocated amount, remaining amount, hold/error and GL links | authorized source drill-down | same preview result | existing AssetReceipt/AssetIssuance and Accounting valuation report; proposed crosscut cost evidence |
| OutputAllocation | list, editable draft | Review distribution and residual variance | output snapshot line, asset/receipt, accepted/held quantity, allocation basis/weight, proposed amount, residual variance and reason; no quantity editing | decimal/currency totals | same preview result; recalculation through `preview#CostClose` | Carbon estimates versus actuals; new allocation controls specified here |
| PostCostClose | dialog | Commit the reviewed balanced allocation | previewId/version, operationKey, accountingDate, approvalDecisionId when required, reason; server totals and ledger proposal read-only | explicit confirmation; resulting source/GL links | proposed `ironstone.accounting.ProductionCostServices.post#CostClose` | existing ledger posting controls; new atomic production allocation |

The fields listed above are the complete business-input contract for these new controls; record
identity, authenticated actor, timestamps and operation outcomes are server-managed. Preview
accepts explicit output weights only where the organization's effective policy permits them.
The server recalculates decimal totals, locks remaining cost events and output allocations,
rejects stale evidence, and validates each source, currency, period and approval. Allocations,
the absorption and variance entries and the resulting ledger links commit once as one run-level
financial event; an independent batch of runs reports named failures and continues. Operational
completion does not imply cost close, and unresolved required stock/quality/financial facts block
final close.

**Production posting rule (D12).** Production cost reaches the GL beside Mantle's existing issue
and receipt postings, and WIP is relieved once (R-SA-01):

1. Manufacturing's proposed `ProductionServices.receive#ProductionOutput` passes `acquireCost` to
   `receive#Asset`. It is the frozen standard unit cost from the run snapshot (the
   ProductStandardCost id and version). Without an approved standard it is cost-to-date divided by
   quantity, and the receipt is marked provisional. It is never null.
2. Material issues and output receipts post only through the existing `AssetIssuanceGlPost`
   (Dr WIP) and `AssetReceiptGlPost` (Dr inventory, Cr WIP at `Asset.acquireCost`) SECAs.
3. The proposed `post#CostClose` posts, in one run-level transaction, Dr WIP and Cr three proposed
   GL account types (AC-07 seed) for the events not yet posted: proposed applied labor (`GatLaborApplied`),
   proposed applied machine and overhead (`GatOverheadApplied`) and
   proposed outside-processing accrual (`GatOutsideProcessAccrued`). It also posts the co-product reallocation, and residual WIP
   to the proposed production variance type (`GatProductionVariance`). It never posts an issue or
   a receipt again.
4. Setup readiness requires `AssetTypeGlAccount.wipAssetGlAccountId` and `transferGlAccountId`
   and a production costing basis per organization.
5. InventoryValuation and CloseChecks list stock movements whose `acctgTransResultEnumId` is
   `AtrNoAcquireCost` or `AtrNoAcctgPreference`, or whose posting went to the error journal
   (recorded as a failure, not `AtrSuccess`; §1.1), and open WIP by run.

The run's `WorkEffort.ownerPartyId` is the organization; Manufacturing's proposed `create#ProductionOrder`
sets it on the run and its operations (R-SA-03). The preview refuses a run whose owner is not
the organization, because Mantle would otherwise book every issue to `GatCogs`.

**Cost events.** Manufacturing's proposed `mantle.work.ProductionServices.record#ProductionCostEvent`
writes every event inside its source posting; this file's ProductionCostServices only allocate and
post. Labor events are written when a Projects timesheet is approved, at the time entry's rate
(R-SA-09). `preview#CostClose` blocks while any time entry on the run is on an unapproved
timesheet; a reopened timesheet writes a reversal event, and a rate change after approval writes a
delta event. Machine events come from Manufacturing's proposed `record#MachineRuntime` at interval close.
Runtime with no effective WorkCenterRate is recorded with its hours and no value, marked unvalued,
and listed in the cost exceptions and the cost close queue; a review writes its cost event once a
rate is effective on its date, and the cost close refuses a run that still has one
(impl-manufacturing §4). Overhead events are computed by `preview#CostClose` from the CostingPolicies policy; the overhead
basis lives only there (R-SA-18). Scrap of issued components or held output comes from
Manufacturing's proposed `record#ProductionLoss` and posts to the proposed `AssetTypeGlAccount.scrapGlAccountId`
or to variance as the policy says.

**Review queue and run close.** Manufacturing's proposed `review#ProductionCosts` puts the run in the queue
that proposed `find#CostCloseQueue` reads; Home MyFinanceWork and CloseChecks show it (R-ACC-09).
`post#CostClose` calls Manufacturing's proposed `transition#ProductionOrder` (Close) in the same transaction,
moving the run from WeComplete to WeClosed (R-SA-11). After close, a new cost event is accepted
only as an adjustment event, which a later `preview#CostClose` in adjustment mode picks up.
Manufacturing's guard refuses WeClosed to WeInPlanning, and WeComplete to WeInProgress, once cost is
posted.

Subcontract service acceptance links to the already recorded production output and inspection.
Company-owned material at a supplier remains company-owned stock/WIP: the vendor facility is owned
by the organization (D14). Manufacturing's proposed `receive#SubcontractOutput` consumes the
components held there, receives the output with the run's workEffortId and calls Purchasing's
proposed `accept#ServiceItem`. Acceptance writes the outside-processing accrual event, and the bill match
writes the price-variance event. The service bill comes through `import#Bill`; the receipt SECA
never bills a service line. The processing accrual
enters WIP once; the supplier bill clears or adjusts it, and never adds the full charge a second
time or receives output stock again. Late bills, time corrections or scrap facts create linked
open-period allocations/variances; they do not rewrite a closed period or historic issue cost.

**Actions:** Manufacturing can request review. Financial readers inspect
authorized evidence; GL/finance approvers preview, approve and post according to separation
policy. A same-app shared link checks financial capability rather than Manufacturing launcher
membership. Posted allocations have linked reversal/adjustment actions through the same guards.

**Actions:** A policy change ends the current BudgetControlPolicy row and starts the next, with its key fields audit-logged (impl-accounting §4). A proposal explains the relevant budget and remaining balance; approval/conversion rechecks under lock. An override requires finance authority and a recorded reason. Commitments are released by cancellation/conversion links, not double-counted alongside actual expense.

**Commitment contract (D10).** Accounting owns the record and the services (R-ACC-06).
Proposed `mantle.other.budget.BudgetCommitment` holds commitmentId, budget and budget item or glAccountId,
timePeriodId, organization, source entity, id and revision, stage (request, PO or expense),
amount and currency, status (Reserved, Converted, Released or Actual), convertedFromId, and the
policy decision or override reason. Proposed `ironstone.accounting.BudgetServices` has
the proposed `check#Budget` (a read-only preview), `reserve#Commitment`, `convert#Commitment` and
proposed `release#Commitment`, each idempotent per source revision. The callers are fixed (R-XC-37):

- Purchasing's proposed `ApprovalServices.decide#PurchaseApproval` calls `check#Budget` and `reserve#Commitment` at request approval, and `convert#Commitment` (request to PO) at PO approval.
- Purchasing's proposed `close#PurchaseRemainders` and a request cancel call `release#Commitment`.
- Accounting's proposed `approve#Payable` calls `convert#Commitment` (PO to actual).

Purchasing's RequirementBudgetAllocation may link to a commitment; it is not the commitment.
BudgetVariance's committed column reads BudgetCommitment.

## 13. Reports

Reports share organization/date/currency filters and drill-down conventions. The form-list result is the exported dataset; an expanded account tree does not change its totals. No report silently repairs the ledger. Financial comparisons use posted amounts by default; operational quantities can use a clearly labeled live basis. Ledger reports read closed periods' GL summary rows (GlAccountOrgTimePeriod), which close computes and stores (§9), and sum open periods from posted AcctgTransEntry rows at read time; `realTimeGlSummary` stays as each organization has it, and no report depends on it (impl-accounting §4).

## 14. Related records

### OrderDetail (Context passed)

**Context passed.** Mount `Accounting/Records/OrderDetail` using OrderDetail, crosscut §3.6. Fix organization; show Header, Items, Invoices/payments, Fulfillment, History, as the crosscut Accounting row has them. Purchasing/order changes stay with their permission sets. Do not require Sales/Purchasing launcher grants to view an authorized source order. Preserve Projects estimates/milestone shares. On a PO, AP issues the supplier's BillUpload link through proposed `create#AccessCapability` ([SupplierBillUpload](#supplierbillupload)).

**Invoice from source (D2).** Create invoice or bill opens the shared InvoiceFromSource dialog
(crosscut §3.6), which calls proposed `ironstone.accounting.InvoiceServices.create#InvoiceFromSource`.
Its inputs are the order part, items and quantities, a through date and a down-payment percent.
The ordered basis uses `mantle.account.InvoiceServices.create#EntireOrderPartInvoice`. The received
basis bills accepted, released quantity only and never calls raw `create#PurchaseShipmentInvoices`.
It applies existing order payments through `mantle.account.PaymentServices.apply#OrderPaymentsToInvoice`,
behind the AC-02 duplicate-source guard. A drop shipment follows Moqui Java's drop-ship model,
with no `confirm#DropShipDelivery`: Purchasing's `finalize#DropShipPurchaseOrder` ships the PO's
and the sales order's shipments, the supplier bill comes through `import#Bill`, and it matches
against the shipped drop-ship delivery ([InvoiceMatch](#invoicematch-context-passed);
impl-purchasing §4; R-SB-20).

**Holds (D7).** A hold banner shows the order's open proposed `mantle.order.OrderHoldReason` rows
(Credit, Change, Purchase) with their reasons and who placed them. Holds are placed by
proposed `mantle.order.OrderServices.hold#Order` and released by proposed `release#OrderHold`, which returns the
order to OrderApproved only when no other reason is open. A credit manager releases a Credit hold
with Release (AR + APPROVE) through proposed `CreditServices.release#CreditHold`, which writes a
CreditHoldDecision. Every BOSS approve action runs a guard that calls proposed
`CreditServices.evaluate#OrderCredit` before `mantle.order.OrderServices.approve#Order`. The same
service runs as a SECA on `check#OrderPreApprove` for Mantle's auto-approval (§1.4). Reservations
made at OrderPlaced stay while the order is held.

**Between pack and ship (D3).** Behind D3's flag (§1.4; impl-accounting §4, F25), the Mantle pack
SECA creates the sales invoice at ShipPacked as InvoiceInProcess, without applying payments, and a
proposed ShipShipped SECA finalizes it, posting it, applying captured payments and sending it.
Revenue and receivable come at shipment. To reopen a package or change the order before shipment,
proposed `ironstone.accounting.InvoiceServices.release#ShipmentDraftInvoice` (shipmentId, reason,
operationId) removes the shipment's lines and OrderItemBilling from the InvoiceInProcess pack
invoice and clears `ShipmentItemSource.invoiceId`. A captured payment stays unapplied, or
proposed `ironstone.accounting.SettlementServices.refund#OrderPayment` refunds it when the change
reduces the order. Warehouse "Reopen package", Pick/Pack put-back and Customer Service's
proposed `apply#OrderChange` call it; the accounting permission is checked inside. After ship,
changes go through returns and credit memos. With the flag off Mantle finalizes the invoice at
pack as before. This is Accounting's receiving action for Customer
Service's cancel-remainder change (D9).

**Needs:** AC-02; AC-03; AC-11.

### ShipmentDetail (Context passed)

**Context passed.** Mount `Accounting/Records/ShipmentDetail` using ShipmentDetail, crosscut §3.8. Fix organization; show Items/sources, receipt/issue facts, money and documents, as the crosscut Accounting row has them. Finance reads physical facts and opens invoice and matching; it does not edit received quantities to force matching. A sales invoice for a shipment comes from the pack SECA (`create#SalesShipmentInvoices`), and behind D3's flag it is finalized when the shipment ships (see [OrderDetail](#orderdetail-context-passed)). A purchase bill for a receipt comes from the InvoiceFromSource dialog on the received basis, which calls proposed `create#InvoiceFromSource` (see [OrderDetail](#orderdetail-context-passed)). The receipt SECA runs only for self-billing suppliers (§1.4). Landed-cost allocation links to [LandedCosts](#landedcosts).

**Needs:** AC-02; AC-03; AC-07.

### Product360 (Context passed)

**Context passed.** Mount `Accounting/Records/Product360` using Product360, crosscut §3.5. Show Summary, Costs/history, source movements and permitted Prices, as the crosscut Accounting row has them; inventory quantities and BOM costs are read projections. Finance controls valuation/revaluation; Products' cost estimators draft and standard-cost approvers approve standard estimates. No price/standard-cost edit rewrites receipt cost or posted ledger value. The Accounting context adds a GL mappings pane over `ProductGlAccount` and `ProductCategoryGlAccount`, organization-scoped and edited by finance admin; PostingDefaults stays the bulk editor, and the Products context does not show the pane. Crosscut §3.5 gains it (impl-accounting §4; R-ACC-22).

**Needs:** AC-07; AC-12.

### ReturnDetail (Context passed)

**Context passed.** Mount `Accounting/Records/ReturnDetail` using ReturnDetail, crosscut §3.18. Show authorization, received/disposed quantity, previous credits/refunds, original invoice/payment and ReturnItemBilling. Accounting issues credit/refund only for eligible quantity/amount under shared cumulative locks. Physical receipt remains Warehouse action. Existing `mantle.order.ReturnServices.process#ReturnItemResponses` runs only inside the settlement service below.

**Settlement (D11).** Accounting owns settlement for customer and supplier returns through
proposed `ironstone.accounting.ReturnSettlementServices.preview#Return` and `settle#Return`
(R-ACC-28). Crosscut §3.18 ReturnSettlement cites the same names.

- In: returnId, item quantity or amount, response (credit, refund or replace), refund method, previewVersion, operationKey; receiptless with a reason.
- Out: the credit invoiceId, the refund paymentId, and the result codes `CreditCapExceeded`, `ReceiptChanged`, `ClosedPeriod`, `RefundPending` and `Forbidden`.
- The preview shows the credit, its tax and rounding lines, and a restocking fee, which is an InvoiceItem on the credit memo.
- Customer Service's proposed `authorize#Return` settles nothing at approval, and Mantle's `ReturnApprovedProcess` keeps only `create#ReturnShipment` (§1.4). An advance replacement or instant credit is an explicit `settle#Return` response with a receipt-due follow-up, and it needs a published policy and the finance capability.
- Settlement reads `ReturnItem.receivedQuantity`, which Warehouse's proposed `receive#ReturnItems` writes for accepted and rejected units alike. A second box, or a unit rejected at the dock, can still be credited against the RMA.
- A receiptless credit is `settle#Return` with `receiptless=true`, a reason and finance approver. `receive#ReturnWithoutShipment` is not exposed.
- A return in `ReturnManResp` (Mantle could not respond automatically) shows its items for a manual response.
- Supplier branch: per the response it creates an incoming supplier credit memo (`InvoiceCreditMemo`, supplier to organization) or a debit note. It links ReturnItemBilling to the original bill item and refuses an amount over the billed eligible value. It credits only the billed portion; returning an unbilled quantity reduces the match-eligible receipt and needs no credit. Warehouse's proposed `ship#SupplierReturn` sets ReturnShipped, and PayablesWorkbench ApplySupplierCredit applies the credit.
- ReturnHeader reaches ReturnReceived when every authorized item is physically handled, and ReturnCompleted only when every item's response is complete; `settle#Return` completes each item it settles through `complete#ReturnItem`. Settlement progress is read from ReturnItemBilling, not a new status.
- `settle#Return` queues match re-evaluation for the affected bills (`MatchServices.queue#MatchReevaluation`).

**Needs:** AC-02; AC-03.

### Approvals (Context passed)

**Context passed.** Mount `Accounting/Approvals` using Approvals waiting, crosscut §3.15. As built (impl-accounting P6, F132), Accounting's own list over `get#UserNotifications`, one call per topic, since the framework service takes one topic. Mount Commons Notifications filtered by the approval topics Accounting owns (below), passed by the mount, and to the current organization and actual approver; `get#UserNotifications` takes a list of topics, in place of the `appName` filter, and Commons' own app chips stay (impl-accounting §4, F43). A bill approval stays in Accounting's list whichever app sent it. Open the source preview before deciding. Decisions call the source service and are recorded there; the notification item is not the authoritative approval.

The Accounting topics (proposed NotificationTopic seed, AC-18) and their handlers (R-ACC-23):

| Topic | Decided through |
| --- | --- |
| `BillApproval` | proposed `InvoiceServices.approve#Payable` |
| `BillHoldRelease` | proposed `MatchServices.release#InvoiceHold`, asked for by proposed `request#HoldRelease` |
| `PaymentRunApproval` | proposed `PaymentRunServices.approve#Run` |
| `CreditHoldRelease` | proposed `CreditServices.release#CreditHold` |
| `BudgetOverride` | the BudgetControls override, recorded on the BudgetCommitment |
| `PaymentValidation` | the guarded Payment status transition |
| `ProductionCostReview` | a notification that opens ProductionCostClose from the cost close queue |

A financial topic with an amount opens the source preview; it is never approved inline from the
list. Crosscut §3.15 gets the Accounting per-app row (R-XC-12).

| Activate | wizard step | Commit approved opening state once | run version, organization, opening date, totals, approval | — | proposed `ironstone.accounting.SetupServices.activate#Accounting` | Carbon ApplyCarbonButton |

**Actions:** Save draft, rerun preview, confirm activation. Opening entries and subledger import identities prevent a repeated activation. Mapping/import errors are reviewable by row; activation waits for a balanced reviewed set. Operational documents may remain drafts until setup permits posting.

OpenItemImport creates real Invoice records (R-ACC-30). Each is InvoiceFinalized (customer) or
InvoiceApproved (supplier), keeps its original due date, carries a proposed opening flag and
posts against the migration clearing account. Aging, dunning and payment runs therefore work on
the first day.

A chart template is a seeded template organization on Mantle's one global chart: a Party with no
transactions, holding its account links, type defaults and mappings, which
`init#PartyAccountingConfiguration` copies into the new organization (`sourcePartyId`). The first
release ships one template, from Mantle's installed chart; country charts whose codes conflict
belong to the country packs (§20; impl-accounting §4). Readiness also checks these rows:

- Single currency until AC-19: every open document and every active price is in the base currency (D18).
- `AssetTypeGlAccount.wipAssetGlAccountId` and `transferGlAccountId` are set, and the organization has a production costing basis (ProductionCostClose rule 4). Without `transferGlAccountId` a transfer issue posts to COGS.
- Mantle's `send_SalesInvoicePastDueEmails` job is still paused (§1.4).

**Actions:** Preview clone conflicts; do not overwrite live posted-history policy. Base currency and COGS changes after activation require a migration/revaluation design, not a routine form save. The COGS method is shown for what it is: Mantle posts actual cost whatever it says (§18.2). The Mantle rule flags (§1.4) and the self-approval setting (§1.1) are audit-logged fields here, and only finance admin sets them.

### PostingDefaults

**Layout:** settings.

**Forms:**

| Form | Kind | Purpose | Highlighted fields | Widgets of note | Services | Derived from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PostingMappings | list, editable rows | Set defaults by business type | organization, mapping kind, type/item/instrument/asset/reason/product/product category, account, effective scope | — | entity (including `ProductGlAccount` and `ProductCategoryGlAccount`) | Accounting/OrgSettings TypeDefaults; ItemTypes; InvoiceTypes; PaymentTypes; PaymentInstruments; AssetTypes; FinAcctTypes; FinAcctReasons; GlAccounts |
| MissingMappings | list | Find unmapped types before posting, and the postings sent to the error journal | kind, enum/type, required account, affected documents; error-journal transaction, failed guard or missing account | — | mantle.ledger.LedgerServices.get#DefaultGlAccountByType | Accounting/OrgSettings MissingConfigForm and AllConfigList |

**Actions:** Show mapping precedence and affected organization. Validate account posting class/currency/organization before save. A missing map blocks the affected posting and names the missing type; it never silently sends all failures to a suspense account. By its source (§1.1), a direct post is refused, and an automatic post goes to the error journal and is listed in MissingMappings.

A count variance's account goes by its reason (impl-warehouse §4; Accounting builds it with valuation, impl-accounting P13): `post#PhysicalInventoryVariance` reads the organization's `VarianceReasonGlAccount` row for the reason, then for a scrap reason the asset type's proposed `scrapGlAccountId`, and otherwise found or shrinkage by sign as before. With nothing mapped it posts as Mantle does, so it needs no flag; the demo organization's InVrScrap and InVrExpired rows are seeded. The two project cost GL account types (project cost and labor clearing) are mapped here (AC-07).

### PaymentTerms

**Layout:** settings.

**Forms:**

| Form | Kind | Purpose | Highlighted fields | Widgets of note | Services | Derived from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SettlementTerms | list, editable rows | Set due terms | name and description, term type, term value and unit (due days or date basis) | — | proposed `store#SettlementTerm` | Mantle SettlementTerm; Carbon PaymentTerms |
| SettlementTermLines | list, editable rows | Split a term into portions with early-payment discounts | sequence, portion percent, days basis, discount percent, discount days, from/thru | — | proposed `store#SettlementTerm` | new |

The listed fields are the full field list of SettlementTermLines; each row is a proposed
`SettlementTermLine`.

**Actions:** Save term for future documents; invoices retain adopted terms and explicit due date. Recompute an existing draft only after confirmation; issued invoice changes are audited.

`SettlementTerm` has only `termTypeEnumId`, `termValue` and `termValueUomId`; the seeded "2% within
10 days" exists only as description text, and Invoice has one `dueDate` (R-ACC-12). Early-payment
discounts and installments are therefore child `SettlementTermLine` rows, effective-dated with
audit-logged fields, saved through `store#SettlementTerm`. At issue a per-invoice proposed
`InvoiceDueSchedule` (due date, amount, discount date, discount amount) is written as the
invoice's own audit-logged rows, so a later term change never alters an issued invoice. Aging,
PayablesWorkbench, PaymentRunDetail and `apply#Settlement` read it, and a discount taken within
its date posts to the discount account, for customer receipts and supplier payments
(impl-accounting §4; R-XC-53).

**Navigation:** The settings entry and Home queues link here; source identifiers open their Accounting detail mount or an authorized shared record. Back preserves find filters.

### Currencies

**Layout:** settings.

**Forms:**

| Form | Kind | Purpose | Highlighted fields | Widgets of note | Services | Derived from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CurrencyList | list | Inspect currency units and rounding | currency code, description, decimals, active | — | entity | Framework Uom; baseline currency conversion |
| ExchangeRates | list, editable rows | Maintain explicit dated rates | from/to currency, from/thru, factor, source, fetched/manual | CSV import | entity; proposed `ironstone.accounting.CurrencyServices.refresh#Rates` | Carbon ExchangeRates; ERPNext Currency Exchange |

**Actions:** Rates are entered by hand or imported from CSV as dated `UomConversion` rows, each marked with its source. With base-currency posting (AC-19), proposed `refresh#Rates` is a provider interface, a service name in the organization's settings; the shipped provider is the European Central Bank's daily reference rates (free, no key; cross rates through EUR). A fetch proposes rates that a finance user accepts before they are active (impl-accounting §4). Documents retain the chosen rate/date/source; later rate edits affect future conversions only. Missing or ambiguous rate blocks affected posting.

Currencies is the only screen that edits currency units and their exchange rates; Products Units
excludes them (D17). Rates are `moqui.basic.UomConversion` rows, whose `conversionFactor` is a
float. Posting therefore stores the applied rate as a decimal, with its date and source, on the
transaction and the document (AC-19).

**Actions:** Preview impact on open orders and pending notices; new policy does not retroactively mark documents paid/approved. Customer-specific limits are edited on Customer360 through proposed `CreditServices.store#Policy`. Fees/interest remain opt-in later policy requiring separate posting.

### MatchPolicies

Accounting owns the bill-match policy (D4; R-PUR-08). Purchasing's PolicyDependencies links here
read-only, and crosscut §3.22 InvoiceMatch reads the policy row from it.

**Layout:** settings.

**Forms:**

| Form | Kind | Purpose | Highlighted fields | Widgets of note | Services | Derived from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MatchPolicyRules | list, editable rows | Set the match rules per organization as effective-dated rows, with product and category overrides | organization, product category or product override, bill basis (ordered or received quantity), receipt required before bill, quantity tolerance, price tolerance and tax tolerance (each a percent or an amount), same-rate action (Warn or Stop), service-acceptance policy, self-billing default for new suppliers, effective from/thru | effective-date overlap check | proposed `ironstone.accounting.MatchServices.store#MatchPolicy` | Odoo product bill control (ordered or received quantities); ERPNext over-billing allowance; new match controls specified here |

The listed fields are the full field list of the new form; each row is
a proposed `mantle.account.invoice.InvoiceMatchPolicy`.

**Actions:** A change ends the current row (`thruDate`) and starts the next (`fromDate`), with its
key fields audit-logged (impl-accounting §4); it applies to bills evaluated from its from date. An
existing match line keeps the policy row it applied and is re-evaluated only through
`MatchServices.queue#MatchReevaluation`. The self-billing default sets the proposed
`SupplierProfile.selfBillingIndicator` of a new supplier; finance changes the indicator on
Supplier360 (D2). A product override wins over a category override, which wins over the
organization row.

The legacy match backfill (design-purchasing §18) is offered here, and in Purchasing's
MatchExceptions, to AP and to a buyer with the match group (impl-accounting §4). Proposed
`MatchServices.preview#LegacyMatches` and `apply#LegacyMatches` link existing bill lines to orders
and receipts only from unambiguous OrderItemBilling and AssetReceipt evidence, name each ambiguous
line as a match exception and go on, and never match an unexplained balance.

### CostingPolicies

Accounting owns the production allocation policy (D12; R-ACC-09). ProductionCostClose reads the
row effective on its accounting date. Manufacturing's ProductionSettings TimeAndCost links
here read-only; the overhead basis lives only here (R-SA-18).

**Layout:** settings.

**Forms:**

| Form | Kind | Purpose | Highlighted fields | Widgets of note | Services | Derived from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ProductionAllocationPolicy | list, editable rows | Set the overhead, co-product and variance policy as effective-dated rows | organization, effective from/thru, overhead basis (a rate per work-center hour, a percentage of direct labor, or none), rates and currency, by-product and co-product method (quantity normalized to a common unit, fixed shares on the BOM's output lines, or relative sales value), variance accounts | decimal rates | proposed `ironstone.accounting.ProductionCostServices.store#AllocationPolicy` | new policy controls specified here; Carbon JobEstimatesVsActuals |

The listed fields are the full field list of the new form; each row is
a proposed `mantle.work.production.ProductionAllocationPolicy`.

**Actions:** A change ends the current row and starts the next, with its key fields audit-logged
(impl-manufacturing §4); a posted cost close keeps the row it used. The default is overhead at a
rate per work-center hour, from WorkCenterRate's overhead component, times the run's actual setup
and run hours, and co-products by quantity normalized to a common unit; the other methods are
selectable (impl-manufacturing §4; R-MFG-34). Explicit output
weights are allowed in ProductionCostClose only where the effective policy permits them.

## 16. Baseline coverage

### 16.1 Candidate inventory and baseline forms

Every research candidate area is represented in §2: recurring bills share RecurringInvoices; customer credits and supplier debit notes are contextual InvoiceDetail/BillDetail records; fixed-asset capitalization, adjustment, disposal and reversal are the EquipmentDetail book dialogs, and stock revaluation is the InventoryValuation preview and post; customer/supplier agreements contribute terms without duplicating agreement authoring. Advanced leases, recognition, FX/deferrals, intercompany/consolidation and electronic invoices are explicit later screens.

The following maps all 166 Accounting inventory forms, plus the financial Party and asset forms this design uses. Names are exact inventory cells. It also records deliberate replacements: UpdateAcctgTransPosted is covered by the read-only posted view plus audited metadata/reversal actions, not an unrestricted amount editor. The implementation column is unchanged.

### 16.2 Service coverage and source verification

The form summaries name directly invoked existing services. The additive service-inventory
mapping follows those names and shared-context calls; helpers only called internally by Mantle
are not assigned UI coverage merely because they exist. Proposed services do not become USL
rows until implemented. Shared InvoiceDetail and other shared mounts add their contextual calls
from crosscut, without replacing Projects mappings.

Current XML checks distinguish four cases: active entities/services; active but incomplete tax
services; commented-out TaxAuthorityRate and cost definitions; and proposed BOSS controls.
`LedgerServices.calculate#GlJournalTrialBalance` is also commented out despite appearing in the
research inventory: JournalBatches instead requires the proposed `JournalServices.validate#Batch`.
Dated currency rates use active `moqui.basic.UomConversion`, not a separate dated-rate entity.

The report adapters read existing data sources (R-ACC-27). SalesAnalysis reads
`SalesReportServices.get#SalesOrderSummary`, `get#SalesInvoiceSummary`, `get#SalesTopProduct` and
`get#InvoicesByCustomerClass`, which the baseline SalesSummary calls. Aging reads the
`InvoiceAgingSummary` and `InvoicePaymentApplicationSummary` views, and InventoryValuation reads
`AssetValuationSummary`. `mantle.account.PaymentServices.apply#OrderPaymentsToInvoice` is called by
`create#InvoiceFromSource` from OrderDetail. `mantle.ledger.AssetAutoPostServices.calculateAndPost#AllFixedAssetDepreciations`
posts without a preview, so no screen calls it; DepreciationRunDetail replaces it.
`LedgerServices.post#GlJournal` counts a transaction diverted to the error journal as posted and
marks the journal posted regardless (impl-accounting F17), so no screen calls it; JournalBatches
uses the proposed `post#Batch` instead. Both stay blank in usl-inventory on purpose (§19).

### 16.3 Acceptance walkthroughs

- **Procure-to-pay:** bill against partial accepted receipt; reject excess/duplicate quantities,
  compare converted units/currency and prior credits; explain tolerance; hold blocks approval
  and payment; authorized release is recorded; supplier bank change invalidates payment approval.
  A receipt from a supplier that is not self-billing creates no bill; a second upload with the
  same supplier reference is refused; a manual payment of a held bill is refused.
- **Invoice-to-cash:** customer invoice, partial receipt, available credit, discount/write-off,
  currency difference, remaining overdue balance and statement; retries do not double-apply.
  An order over its credit limit is held on approval and released by a credit manager with a
  reason; a package reopened after pack releases its draft invoice lines, and the invoice is
  finalized only when the shipment ships.
- **Return-to-refund:** receive part of an RMA, credit only eligible uncredited quantity, refund
  within the original paid balance, reverse with source links; supplier return creates the
  payable credit with unchanged physical facts. A second box received later is still credited;
  approval of the RMA alone creates no credit, refund or replacement.
- **Production-to-GL:** issue/return material, partial output, scrap and labor post through their
  source movements; ProductStandardCost changes leave history intact; deliberate revaluation
  has a preview and ledger links; reconcile inventory/WIP/GL by organization and period.
  Output is received at the frozen standard, cost close posts absorption and variance once, WIP
  for the run ends at zero, and the run closes in the same transaction.
- **Bank-to-close:** duplicate and malformed statement rows, ambiguous matches, missing line,
  stale concurrent match and nonzero statement difference; close blocks until resolved; a
  closed period rejects backdated invoice, refund, reversal and depreciation equally. A backdated
  direct post into a locked period is refused, and an automatic post goes to the error journal
  with the lock named.
- **Batch/activation:** fail one statement row, notice recipient, independent supplier payment
  or asset depreciation item and retain other outcomes. Each item’s financial mutation is
  atomic. A lost response resumes by operation identity. Opening trial balance and subledgers
  tie before activation; repeated activation cannot duplicate balances.
- **Access:** an AR-only user cannot capture a gateway payment or see bank credentials; an app
  mount change cannot reveal another organization's balances; a customer token cannot read
  another invoice, internal Chatter or rates; supplier upload never approves a bill.

## 17. Documents and outputs

| Output | Kind | From screen | Derived from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Invoice, credit memo, supplier bill/debit note | `html-print`, PDF through existing renderer; sent by proposed `send#Invoice` with the InvoicePay link | InvoiceDetail / BillDetail / Invoices InvoiceBatch | Baseline Accounting/Invoice/PrintInvoice; Projects invoice output |
| Payment QR code and structured payment reference (later) | QR block in the invoice `html-print` template | InvoiceDetail | Proposed `Invoice.paymentReference` (AC-20); BankRules can match a bank line on it; Odoo `account_qr_code_sepa` and `account_qr_code_emv` |
| Customer statement and reminder letter | `html-print`, PDF, email | Statements / Dunning / Customer360 | ReceivableStatement; ERPNext dunning letter |
| Payment receipt, check and payment detail | `html-print`, PDF | PaymentDetail / PaymentRunDetail | Baseline payment detail/check print services |
| NACHA / Positive Pay, bank return results | File generation/import | PaymentRunDetail | Existing NachaServices / PositivePayServices; selected bank format only |
| Bank statement and reconciliation evidence | `html-print`, CSV, attachment | BankAccountDetail / ReconciliationDetail | PaymentMethodTrans plus proposed session snapshot |
| Financial account statement | `html-print`, PDF | FinancialAccountDetail | FinancialAccountServices.get#StatementPrintInfo |
| Journal, period-close and depreciation evidence | `html-print`, CSV | JournalEntryDetail / PeriodCloseDetail / DepreciationRunDetail | Existing ledger data plus reviewed run versions |
| Tax statement / 1099 data and validated filing format | `html-print`, configured export | TaxStatementDetail | Existing TaxServices data; versioned format adapter required |
| E-invoice payload and acknowledgement | SystemMessage / configured XML or structured format | ElectronicInvoices | InvoiceSystemMessage; later exchange adapters |
| Report snapshot | `html-print`, CSV; optional configured spreadsheet export | All report screens | Existing report result dataset with filters/currency/date included |
| Chart, balances, bank statements, bills | Import with preview and row results | Setup / StatementImport / Bills | Existing import primitives and proposed review adapters |
| Payment, tax, statement and close notices | Email / shell notification | Source screen or approved scheduled run | Commons/Comms delivery and source-specific providers |

Outputs use the same authorized result as the screen; an export is not a second unrestricted
query. Durable outputs retain organization, as-of date, currency basis and source/version IDs.
Sending is an explicit UI action or previously authorized schedule policy. Templates are
localized resources, with missing locale falling back visibly to the organization default.

## 18. Framework and data needs

All `ironstone.accounting.*Services` families named in forms are **new proposed** service
contracts. Their mutations wrap verified Mantle primitives with the controls below. Proposed
entity names specify intended ownership and relationships, not a claim that schemas exist.
Each family returns document/result identifiers plus named per-item errors for independent
batches. The shared crosscut roll-up deduplicates these needs with other apps.

| Need | Kind | Proposed as | Used by | Stub spec |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AC-01 Organization scope and activation | service type, seed data | `ironstone.accounting.AccessServices`, `SetupServices`; proposed `mantle.ledger.config.AccountingSetupRun`; seeded capability groups | Every screen; Setup; settings | Resolve allowed organizations and finance capabilities; readiness over chart/defaults/periods/tax/bank; versioned preview of opening GL/subledgers and one activation identity. `clone#Preferences` previews conflicts. The §1.1 capability groups and organization scope fold into crosscut CX-ACCESS; activation and AccountingSetupRun stay here (R-XC-18). Seed data: the §1.1 groups, including proposed `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_MATCH`, with `BOSS_ACCOUNTING` as the root user group and artifact group and the organization filters of §1; and one chart template, a template organization from Mantle's installed chart that `init#PartyAccountingConfiguration` copies (§15 Setup). `import#OpenItems` creates each open invoice and bill at cutover, with a proposed opening flag and per-row results. Readiness checks single currency (AC-19), the WIP and transfer accounts, the costing basis and the paused reminder job. |
| AC-02 Financial document and settlement controls | service type, data model | `InvoiceServices`, `SettlementServices`, `ReturnSettlementServices` in `ironstone.accounting`; proposed `mantle.account.PortalServices`; proposed `SettlementTermLine` and `InvoiceDueSchedule`; extend relevant Mantle mutators with shared checks | Invoice/bill/payment/return/shared mounts | Guard state transitions, mutable fields, source eligibility, duplicate supplier reference, balance locks, period and idempotency. `apply#Settlement` previews/application records include authorized discount/write-off/FX with accounts. `settle#Return`: see crosscut CX-RETURNS for its cumulative guard over received, credited and refunded quantities and existing ReturnItemBilling; this row specifies the proposed `preview#Return`, the result codes and the supplier branch (R-ACC-28, R-SB-05). Preserve Projects access and billing links. Proposed `change#InvoiceState` is the single invoice state guard (status, period, posting, hold), and Projects `BillingServices.update#InvoiceStatus` calls it (D6). `send#Invoice` sends any invoice, with or without a store, stores the sent PDF as the invoice's content, and issues the InvoicePay link through `PortalServices.issue#InvoiceAccess`; the Mantle `InvoiceFinalizedSendEmail` SECA skips an invoice version it has sent. `import#Bill` keys a bill by organization, supplier and supplier reference, or shipmentId when self-billed, and takes AP intake's and a Purchasing buyer's uploads; `create#InvoiceFromSource` bills ordered or accepted received quantity and applies order payments (D2). Behind D3's flag the pack SECA leaves the sales invoice InvoiceInProcess and a ShipShipped SECA finalizes it; `release#ShipmentDraftInvoice` and `SettlementServices.refund#OrderPayment` serve the changes between pack and ship (D3). The hold guard inside Mantle, where a payment is applied to a payable invoice, with no flag, refuses a bill with an open hold for `apply#Settlement`, payable `create#InvoicePayment` and `apply#InvoicePayment` and payment runs, and the `PaymentApplyForInvoice` and `InvoiceApplyForPayments` SECAs leave such a payment unapplied (D4). Extend `create#Invoice` term precedence to agreement term, SupplierProfile, then PartyAcctgPreference (R-ACC-16). Payment terms: `SettlementTermLine` effective-dated rows saved through `store#SettlementTerm`, and the per-invoice `InvoiceDueSchedule` written at issue, which aging, the workbenches, runs and `apply#Settlement` read; a discount taken within its date posts to the discount account (§15 PaymentTerms). `mantle.account.PortalServices` (`issue#InvoiceAccess`, `get#Invoice`, `start#InvoicePayment`, `get#PaymentResult`, `submit#SupplierBill`, `get#Submission`) are in Mantle so the PASS Billing and Supplier pages can call them, locally or remotely, each an operation of PASS's facade served by Mantle's PassApi; each calls `ExternalAccessServices.check#AccessCapability` first and keeps no token rules of its own (impl-accounting §4). |
| AC-03 Three-way match and holds | data model, service type | Proposed `mantle.account.invoice.InvoiceMatch`, `InvoiceMatchLine`, `InvoiceHold`, `InvoiceMatchPolicy`; `ironstone.accounting.MatchServices` | InvoiceMatch; Bills; BillDetail; MatchPolicies; Purchasing shared match context | Persist source snapshot/version, allocation of invoice line to PO and accepted receipt, UOM/currency bases, quantities/prices/tax, tolerance result and recorded exception release. `evaluate#InvoiceMatch`, `apply#InvoiceMatch`, `release#InvoiceHold` revalidate under lock; holds are separate from Invoice status. Proposed MatchServices services: `evaluate#InvoiceMatch`, `apply#InvoiceMatch` (writes or updates `OrderItemBilling`; unapply reverses it), proposed `find#BillExceptions`, `hold#Invoice`, `release#InvoiceHold`, proposed `request#HoldRelease`, `queue#MatchReevaluation`, `store#MatchPolicy`, and the legacy match backfill's `preview#LegacyMatches` and `apply#LegacyMatches` (§15 MatchPolicies). `InvoiceMatchPolicy` is effective-dated rows with audit-logged key fields, and a match line keeps the row it applied. A shipped drop-ship delivery is match evidence (impl-purchasing §4). Seed hold reasons: match exception, AP review, supplier dispute, bank-detail change. Quantity under open inspection is excluded (proposed `QualityServices.get#SourceInspectionStatus`). InvoiceMatch has a single-field key and no Files tab; evidence files stay on the bill. Mantle change (D2, behind its flag): `ShipmentIncomingDeliveredCreateInvoices` runs only for a supplier with the proposed `SupplierProfile.selfBillingIndicator`, and `create#PurchaseShipmentInvoices` gains the proposed `acceptedOnly` parameter. The hold guard is inside Mantle, behind its flag (AC-02). |
| AC-04 Payment runs | data model | Proposed `mantle.account.payment.PaymentRun`, `PaymentRunItem`; `PaymentRunServices` | PaymentRuns / PaymentRunDetail | Header organization/bank/currency/date/instrument/status/version; item invoice/remaining/selected/payment/file/result. Approval freezes proposal; execution rechecks hold/bank/version and creates one payment instruction identity. Existing check/NACHA/Positive Pay outputs consume those payments; no duplicate sends. A change to a supplier's bank details voids a pending approval of a run that pays it (D26). |
| AC-05 Bank statement sessions and matching rules | data model | Proposed `mantle.account.method.BankReconciliation`, `BankReconciliationLine`, `BankMatchRule`, `StatementImport`; `BankServices` | Banking | Session owns statement period/opening/closing/snapshot and links existing PaymentMethodTrans; no replacement bank ledger. Match rules suggest first; finalization requires zero difference and resolved import failures. Record exclusions/reopen reasons. FIT/source-row keys deduplicate imports. The import format enum and the FIT/source-row identity also fit ISO 20022 camt.053 and MT940, the next adapters. |
| AC-06 Posting locks and close controls | data model | Proposed `mantle.ledger.config.AccountingLock`, `AccountingLockException`, `AccountingCloseRun`; `CloseServices`; shared posting guard | All postings; PeriodClose | Typed organization lock-through dates, approved expiring soft exceptions, immutable hard close. Lock scopes go by the transaction's source document: sales, purchases, tax and all (§9 PeriodLocks). Guard direct and source-triggered posting, adjustments, refunds, reversals; a failure is refused for a direct post and goes to the error journal, named, for an automatic one, and close refuses a period holding one (§1.1). Close snapshots checks/balances and atomically commits with existing period close; reversal retains original. The guard runs inside `post#AcctgTrans`, the single choke point for direct and auto-post (§1.1); BOSS_ACCOUNTING_* groups get no artifact authorization for `unpost#AcctgTrans`, `update#AcctgTransPosted`, `repost#*` or the Mantle REST mutators (R-ACC-14). Mantle change (R-SA-02): `repost#AssetIssuance`, run by the `AssetIssuanceGlRePost` SECA, posts a dated reversing delta in an open period instead of unposting and deleting the original. |
| AC-07 Asset books, valuation and reviewed depreciation | data model, service type, seed data | Proposed `mantle.product.asset.FixedAssetClass`, shared `mantle.ledger.transaction.AccountingPeriodRun`/result; `AssetBookServices`; `ProductionCostServices` over canonical ProductionCostEvent/ProductionCostAllocation; proposed `mantle.product.asset.AssetBookEvent`, `mantle.account.invoice.LandedCostAllocation`, `mantle.work.production.ProductionAllocationPolicy` | Assets; Inventory; LandedCosts; CostingPolicies; PostingDefaults; close; Products/Manufacturing/Warehouse | Preserve Asset/AssetDepreciation; class defaults as effective-dated `FixedAssetClass` rows with audit-logged key fields. Preview per asset-period then post each once. Capitalization/disposal/revaluation use linked ledger entries. Consume proposed `mantle.product.cost.ProductStandardCost` / `ProductStandardCostComponent` from Products as estimates; Accounting alone posts revaluation/landed-cost allocations. ProductionCostClose previews and posts WIP/output allocation and variance once; crosscut CX-COST owns the evidence model, with subcontract accrual clearing and linked late adjustments. Proposed book services `capitalize#Asset`, `adjust#AssetBook`, `dispose#Asset` and `reverse#AssetBookEvent` each write an AssetBookEvent (asset, event type, date, amounts, accounts, reversal link) with ledger links (R-ACC-08). Proposed `post#Revaluation` posts value-only adjustments and never calls `update#ProductAcquireCost` on posted receipts (R-ACC-02). Proposed `preview#LandedCost` and `post#LandedCost` allocate charge lines to receipts (R-ACC-10). Proposed `ProductionCostServices.store#AllocationPolicy` saves the allocation policy as effective-dated rows, and `find#CostCloseQueue` lists runs put up for review. ProductionCostClose follows the production posting rule (D12): output at the frozen standard, issues and receipts only through the existing hooks, absorption and variance at cost close, and the run closed in the same transaction. Seed the proposed GL account types `GatLaborApplied`, `GatOverheadApplied`, `GatOutsideProcessAccrued` and `GatProductionVariance`, and propose `AssetTypeGlAccount.scrapGlAccountId` for scrap; `post#PhysicalInventoryVariance` reads `VarianceReasonGlAccount` by reason, then `scrapGlAccountId` for a scrap reason (§15 PostingDefaults; impl-warehouse §4). Project cost posting (impl-accounting §4): `mantle.ledger.OtherAutoPostServices.post#WorkEffortCost`, on project timesheet approval behind its flag, reclasses approved project time at the entry's cost rate, debiting project cost and crediting a labor clearing account (both GL account types seeded and mapped in PostingDefaults), with the project on the transaction; keyed by time entry on the operation record (§18.1), it posts a dated reversing delta when the approval is undone or the entry changes. Production time is excluded, since Manufacturing's labor events post it (D12). |
| AC-08 Working local tax and statements | data model | Corrected active `mantle.other.tax.TaxAuthorityRate`; extend `mantle.other.TaxServices.calculate#SalesTaxLocal` and `calculate#InvoiceSalesTax`; `ironstone.accounting.TaxServices` | Tax; all invoices/orders | Effective rules by authority/category/code/jurisdiction, inclusion/compound basis, priority and rate; retain calculation version and line results. Existing gateway interface continues; organization fallback supports non-store invoices. Fix old commented relationships. Tax error blocks affected finalization; tax exemption/zero is explicit, not fallback on failure. |
| AC-09 Recurring billing | data model | Proposed `mantle.account.invoice.InvoiceSchedule`, `InvoiceScheduleOccurrence`; `RecurringServices` and ServiceJob | RecurringInvoices | Template or Subscription source, party/direction/currency, cadence/dates, next period, opt-in send policy. Unique schedule-period generation, per-occurrence result; drafts by default, no repeat after job retry. InvoiceSchedule serves only invoice-only cadences (rent, retainers, recurring supplier bills); order-based recurring billing stays on OrderHeader `recurCronExpression` and `recurAutoInvoice` with the `create_RecurringOrders` job, which RecurringInvoices monitors (D24). |
| AC-10 Collections and dunning | data model | Proposed `mantle.account.invoice.CollectionPromise`, `DunningLevel`, `DunningRun`, `DunningNotice`; `CollectionServices` | Collections / Dunning / Statements / Customer360 | Reuse WorkEffort activities and record links; add amount/currency/date/qualifying invoice/payment links for promises. Exclude disputes; preview recipient/content; deduplicate notices by run/level/document set. Later fee/interest creates reviewed financial documents. Dunning is the only scheduled reminder sender; the Mantle `send_SalesInvoicePastDueEmails` job stays paused. |
| AC-11 Customer credit policy | data model, service type | Proposed `mantle.account.billing.CustomerCreditPolicy`, `CreditHoldDecision`; `CreditServices`; `CreditServices.store#Policy`, `evaluate#OrderCredit`, `release#CreditHold`; uses proposed `mantle.order.OrderHoldReason` with `OrderServices.hold#Order` and `release#OrderHold` (crosscut §3.6) | Customer360; OrderDetail; Approvals; orders; invoice controls | Policy per organization/customer/currency, amount limit and overdue threshold, Warn/Hold, effective dates; do not overload BillingAccount.accountLimit for all customers. Explain exposure (open orders + unpaid invoices minus non-duplicated credits), check on commitment, and record authorized hold/release reason. `evaluate#OrderCredit` takes orderId, orderPartSeqId, organizationPartyId and operationKey, and returns exposure, limit, currency, rate basis, Pass/Warn/Hold and reasons. It runs as a SECA on `check#OrderPreApprove` (an approve warning) and inside the guard every BOSS approve action uses (D7). A Hold result calls the proposed `hold#Order` with reason Credit; reservations made at OrderPlaced stay. `release#CreditHold` writes a CreditHoldDecision (order part, decision, reason, approver, expiry) and calls `release#OrderHold`. |
| AC-12 Finance report adapters and drill-down | service type | `ironstone.accounting.ReportServices`, `HomeServices`; existing LedgerReportServices and authorized form-list views | Home; Reports; shared 360s | Add partner ledger, as-of aging, source tie-out, multi-period columns and drill-down preserving organization/date/currency. Reuse current report result queries for compatibility; return incomplete/error metadata. Per-app aggregates are providers, not a second Insights dashboard model. Data sources: the SalesReportServices summaries, the InvoiceAgingSummary, InvoicePaymentApplicationSummary and AssetValuationSummary views, and GlAccountOrgTimePeriod for closed periods, with open periods summed from posted AcctgTransEntry rows (§13, §16.2). |
| AC-13 Entry templates and batch validation | data model | Proposed `mantle.ledger.transaction.AcctgTransTemplate`, `AcctgTransTemplateEntry`; `JournalServices` | JournalTemplates / JournalBatches | Versioned accounts/amount parameters; instantiate a balanced draft with source version. `validate#Batch` validates current constituent entries; proposed `post#Batch` uses atomic per-transaction posts and named partial results rather than post#GlJournal, which counts a transaction diverted to the error journal as posted (impl-accounting F17). Commented GlJournalTrialBalance is not called. |
| AC-14 Budget revisions and commitments | service type, data model | `ironstone.accounting.BudgetServices` (`check#Budget`, `reserve#Commitment`, `convert#Commitment`, `release#Commitment`); proposed `BudgetControlPolicy` and `mantle.other.budget.BudgetCommitment` alongside existing BudgetRevision/Review and BudgetParty | Budgets; Purchasing; expenses | Keep GL-account/period budget. Budget amounts are audit-logged, so a revision is a time and BudgetVariance reads a budget as of one; the approved budget's PDF is stored as its content; the organization comes from the budget's period and other parties are BudgetParty rows. `BudgetControlPolicy` is effective-dated rows with audit-logged key fields (impl-accounting §4). Warn/Stop by request/PO/expense stage, lock remaining amount at approval, convert/release commitments without double counting actuals; record override. BudgetCommitment holds the budget item or GL account, period, organization, source entity/id/revision, stage, amount and currency, status (Reserved, Converted, Released, Actual), convertedFromId and the override reason; each service is idempotent per source revision (D10). Purchasing reserves at request approval, converts request to PO at PO approval and releases on close or cancel; `approve#Payable` converts PO to actual. |
| AC-15 Electronic invoice exchange | data model | Proposed `mantle.account.invoice.InvoiceExchange`; `ExchangeServices` over InvoiceSystemMessage and framework protocol adapters | ElectronicInvoices; inbound bills | Versioned payload/format/provider/status and external reference, validation/acknowledgement history, idempotent submit/poll, correction by revision. Jurisdiction/provider adapters are later, separately validated. Missing X12 component not assumed. |
| AC-16 Rates, revaluation and deferral | service type | `CurrencyServices`, `PeriodRunServices`; proposed deferral schedule/result alongside AccountingPeriodRun | Currencies / AdvancedPeriodRun | Use active UomConversion effective dates and persist exact rate/source; manual and CSV-imported rates first, then `refresh#Rates` with AC-19 as a provider interface named in the organization's settings, the European Central Bank's daily reference rates shipped, each fetch proposing rates a finance user accepts before they are active (§15 Currencies). Approved FX/deferral preview posts once with source allocation and optional dated reversal. Financial calculation uses decimals; no silent float-rounding drift. The applied rate is stored as a decimal on the transaction (AC-19); FX revaluation follows base-currency posting. |
| AC-17 Advanced finance models | data model | Proposed `AccountingLease`, `RevenueSchedule`, `IntercompanyBatch` and versioned schedule/entry children; `LeaseServices`, `RecognitionServices`, `IntercompanyServices` | Later leases, recognition and intercompany | Lease terms/rate/policy and liability/amortization schedule; obligation-based recognition allocations; paired organization entries with both permissions/periods. Shared AccountingPeriodRun stores posted results. Consolidation/report adjustments leave local books intact. |
| AC-18 Providers, output and import review | shell item, service type | Accounting palette/quick-create/Today/approval providers; `DocumentServices` and import adapters using existing render/delivery primitives | All named shell sources and outputs | Names/record context from §1.3; localized print templates; approved scheduled sends; batch status and row error downloads. Inspect current framework upload/print capabilities before adding widgets. No new general protocol client belongs in BOSS. Approval topics `BillApproval`, `BillHoldRelease`, `PaymentRunApproval`, `CreditHoldRelease`, `BudgetOverride` and `PaymentValidation`, and the notification `ProductionCostReview` (§14 Approvals); Accounting's Approvals mount passes them to `get#UserNotifications` as its topic list. Folds into crosscut CX-SHELL (R-XC-18). |
| AC-19 Base-currency posting and realized FX | data model, service type | Extend `mantle.ledger.InvoiceAutoPostServices`, `mantle.ledger.PaymentAutoPostServices` and `post#AcctgTrans`; proposed applied-rate fields on Invoice and Payment | All postings; ReceivablesWorkbench; PayablesWorkbench; Currencies; AdvancedPeriodRun; Setup | Posting converts each document amount to `PartyAcctgPreference.baseCurrencyUomId`. It stores the applied decimal rate, rate date and source on the transaction, fills the existing `AcctgTrans.originalCurrencyUomId` and `AcctgTransEntry.originalCurrencyAmount`, and keeps the same rate on the Invoice or Payment. `post#PaymentApplication` books the realized difference to `GatForExGain` or `GatForExLoss`. Until this ships, the posting guard refuses, behind D18's flag (§1.4), to finalize or post a document whose currency differs from base, and Setup readiness shows "single currency until AC-19" (D18; R-ACC-01, which names it AC-16a). FX revaluation (AC-16) depends on it. |
| AC-20 Internal transfers, deposits and payment references | seed data, data model, service type | Implemented `PtInternalTransfer` with its transit `PaymentTypeGlAccount`, `Payment.overrideTypeGlAccountId` and `feeForPaymentId`; `mantle.account.PaymentServices.preview#InternalTransfer` / `create#InternalTransfer`, with the review a `PaymentReview` row; later proposed `PaymentDeposit`, `Payment.paymentDepositId`, `Invoice.paymentReference` and `create#DepositSlip` | Payments; BankAccountDetail; BankRules; invoice print (later) | A transfer is one Payment from the organization to itself, whose `post#Payment` posts an outgoing and an incoming transaction through the transit account, committed atomically, each side reconciled on its own statement; a fee is its own payment (R-ACC-17). A deposit groups receipts of one bank account and currency, so the deposit's bank line reconciles once (R-ACC-33). Built in P9 for receipts already booked to the bank account; a deposit of receipts held in an undeposited-funds account, which needs a posting to the bank, is deferred (impl-accounting §7). The structured payment reference and the QR block on the invoice print are later; BankRules can match on the reference (R-ACC-34). |
| AC-21 Journal entry attachments | data model | Proposed `mantle.ledger.transaction.AcctgTransContent`, registered in `mantle.party.CommunicationServices.get#RecordLinkInfo`; folds into crosscut CX-RECORD-HOSTS | JournalEntryDetail | AcctgTrans has a single-field key, so it hosts RecordFiles once it has its own content entity (D25; R-ACC-31). |
| AC-22 Ledger dimensions | data model, service type | Proposed `AcctgTransEntry.facilityId` and `costCenterId` (an internal organization Party); a proposed required-dimension setting on `GlAccountOrganization`; proposed `OrderItem.costCenterId` and `InvoiceItem.costCenterId` | AccountDetail, JournalEntryDetail, ExpensePosting, PostingMappings; Purchasing requests and orders; Projects and People postings | Posting refuses an entry missing a dimension its account requires; the invoice and payment auto-post services copy facility and cost centre from the source line; reports filter and group by both. Percentage distribution is `later` (R-ACC-11; decided Oct 28, 2026). |

### 18.1 Financial interface details

The shared adapter contract takes authenticated organization scope, source identity and the
client operation identity; preview responses include source version, calculated effects,
blocking/warning reasons and permitted actions. Confirmation supplies the preview version,
not client-computed totals. Posting re-reads authoritative quantities/balances; on conflict it
returns a new preview requirement. The invoice matching and return settlement service names
above are shared with Purchasing/Warehouse/Customer Service, not separately implemented there.

The operation identity is one Mantle operation record (CX-POSTING; impl-accounting §4), keyed by
`operationKey`, with the operation type, organization, user, time, request hash, preview version,
status and links to the records it made or posted. Each posting service checks and writes it in
the posting's transaction: a retry with the same hash returns the stored result, and a different
request under the same key is refused. It is a fact with an identity of its own, so it is a
record rather than an `operationKey` field on each target; Warehouse, Manufacturing, Purchasing
and Customer Service use the same record.

`CustomerCreditPolicy` is keyed by organization/customer/effective version. Exposure is shown
in the policy currency with its conversion basis; fulfilled orders already invoiced are not
counted again. A missing FX rate is a blocking inability to evaluate a Hold policy. Releasing
credit hold is a recorded decision on the source order, surfaced in Customer360 and Approvals.
Mantle approves an order on two paths, and both reach the credit check (R-SB-09): `autoApprove#Order`
through the `check#OrderPreApprove` SECA, and a manual approve through the BOSS approve guard. The
hold is an OrderHold with an OrderHoldReason of Credit, so another app's hold reason is never
released by a credit decision (R-SB-08).

The local tax gateway remains swappable and supports order and invoice inputs without a
ProductStore by organization policy. A tax result stores its authority, rate/version, taxable
base, exemption reason, rounded amount and source item. `calculate#InvoiceSalesTax` writes
proper tax items; it cannot treat an unimplemented local gateway as successful zero tax.
Country-specific tax filing, statutory templates and e-invoice networks remain disabled until
their format adapters are independently validated for the selected deployment.

### 18.2 Proposed model boundaries

`PaymentMethodTrans` remains the imported statement line. `BankReconciliationLine` attaches it
to a session and records selection/review; neither `GlReconciliation` nor a new bank ledger
replaces the working import/match model. General non-bank GL reconciliation can use the existing
GlReconciliation later without forcing bank migration.

A standard-cost approval from Products records an estimate/version. A valuation change in
Accounting identifies affected live layers/assets and its effective date, previews the
adjustment, then posts value-only movements with ledger links. BOM cost roll-up is never a
shortcut for rewriting historical issue/receipt cost. The organization's COGS method
(`PartyAcctgPreference.cogsMethodEnumId`: LIFO, FIFO, average cost or inventory actual cost) is read
by no Mantle service: posting is always at each asset's actual acquire cost, whatever it says
(impl-accounting F40). Setup, AccountingPreferences and every valuation preview show it for what
it is, beside the production costing basis. Mantle has no standard
COGS method; the standard cost in this design is the frozen basis of a production output receipt
(ProductionCostClose), with variance posted at cost close.

## 19. Decided

| Decision | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Full research scope, phased | First release includes parity plus tax, matching, payment-run, close and credit controls needed for complete business flows. Advanced FX/deferrals, leases, recognition, intercompany/consolidation and e-invoicing are designed as later screens. |
| Mantle journal semantics retained | GlJournal is a posting batch. Sales/purchase/cash/bank views use document types, transaction types and bank accounts; no second Odoo-style book record is introduced. |
| Shared invoice/online payment | Crosscut owns internal InvoiceDetail with AP/AR/Projects contexts. Accounting owns one InvoicePay page that Commerce can mount; common external capabilities replace separate portal implementations. Public-facing applications are in mr-pass and internal ones in mr-boss, so the pages are two PASS apps by owner and audience: InvoicePay in Billing, for customers, and SupplierBillUpload as BillUpload in Supplier, for suppliers, which Purchasing extends; not under the Accounting root, and not BOSS audience roots (impl-accounting §4, reversing D5's two roots; R-ACC-03, R-SB-14). Public accounts hold no UserGroup, and there are no BOSS portal groups. The `Accounting/External/*` rows are dropped. Single-record links are pages of the apps taking their tokens, checked by the proposed Mantle `ExternalAccessServices`; the pages call only Mantle's `PortalServices`, through PASS's facade, locally or remotely. This settles the Open item on one suite route group. |
| Shared settings access | Authorized finance users edit common tax, terms and method records here; store bindings can be included in Commerce; executable gateway settings/secrets remain Admin-restricted. PaymentMethods owns PaymentMethod and PaymentGatewayConfig bindings, and Tax owns TaxAuthority and the tax gateway, in the crosscut §5 owner table (R-XC-16). |
| Local rates plus external gateways | Refine and activate a corrected TaxAuthorityRate model and implement local/invoice tax; external gateway interface remains supported. The legacy commented definition and stubs are not working functionality. |
| Customer credit model | CustomerCreditPolicy per customer/organization/currency, edited on Customer360; order hold appears on OrderDetail and Approvals. BillingAccount retains its narrower account-limit meaning. The hold is an OrderHold with a proposed OrderHoldReason of Credit, placed and released through `OrderServices.hold#Order` and `release#OrderHold` (D7; R-SB-08). `CreditServices.evaluate#OrderCredit` runs as a SECA on `check#OrderPreApprove` and in the BOSS approve guard; it does not build on `OrderBeingChanged` (R-ACC-05, R-SB-09). |
| Collections model | Existing activities on the customer plus small promise/dunning records; no second case system. Disputes can link existing Requests. |
| Reconciliation model | Session over PaymentMethodTrans; preserve existing import/match services and record reopened statement history. GlReconciliation is not the bank replacement. |
| Posting locks | New typed lock/exception records supplement TimePeriod.isClosed. No soft exception bypasses a hard closed period. Lock scopes go by the transaction's source document: sales by invoices the organization issued, purchases by invoices it received, tax by `GatTax` entries and the tax transaction types, and all for everything else (impl-accounting §4; Odoo company lock dates). |
| Fixed-asset ownership | One Asset record, financial Book tab and Accounting list. Other apps receive permitted summaries; capitalization, disposal, value adjustment and depreciation require finance capabilities. |
| Posted transaction corrections | Baseline unrestricted UpdateAcctgTransPosted/unpost amount editing is replaced by immutable posted view, audited metadata correction, and linked reversal/new entry. Draft deletion and movement remain. |
| Invoice balances | Partly paid/overdue are derived; gateway return URLs or manual status editing never settle an invoice. Existing AR/AP status IDs are preserved behind guarded transitions. |
| Stock and financial facts remain distinct | Invoice/match screens do not create fictional receipt quantities; return receipt and credit/refund have separate recorded outcomes. |
| Payroll/time and expenses | People/Projects capture and approve; Accounting codes, posts and pays approved source invoices. Existing time locks and Project billing context are preserved. |
| No duplicate master models | Party contacts, ProductPrice, Asset, invoice/payment applications, WorkEffort activities, UomConversion and the OrderHeader recurrence are reused; proposed needs are limited to missing workflows and controls. |
| Current service truth wins | Commented GlJournalTrialBalance is excluded despite its inventory row. Tax-rate/cost comments are proposals to refine. Actual active names are checked before implementation. |
| Baseline forms covered | §16 maps all Accounting forms including report variants and lower-volume financial-account/bank controls; no unexplained parity deletion. Generic report options consolidate old launch forms into their named report. Asset/FindAsset `UpdateProductCost` maps to InventoryValuation CostDataRepair and Asset/AssetDetail `UpdateAssetAcquireCost` to EquipmentDetail AcquireCostRepair (R-ACC-02). |
| Existing automation | The Mantle SECAs and ServiceJobs on the designed paths are named in §1.4, each kept, conditioned or replaced (D1). Crosscut §1.3 holds the suite register. |
| Supplier bill creation | Accounting owns bill intake (D2; R-XC-01, R-SB-01, R-ACC-07). With D2's flag on, a receipt creates no bill by default: the receipt SECA runs only for suppliers flagged self-billing, and then bills accepted, released quantity only. `import#Bill` is keyed by organization, supplier and supplier reference (shipmentId for a self-billed draft), and takes uploads from AP intake and from a Purchasing buyer for a PO of the buyer's organization (impl-accounting §4). Bills from a PO or receipt come from the InvoiceFromSource dialog on the shared OrderDetail and ShipmentDetail (`create#InvoiceFromSource`). A supplier upload attaches to an existing self-billed draft. This settles the Open items on auto-invoice policy and on invoice creation in OrderDetail and ShipmentDetail. Subcontract and service lines are billed only through `import#Bill` (D14). |
| Sales invoice at pack, finalized at ship | Behind D3's flag the pack SECA creates the sales invoice InvoiceInProcess without applying payments, and a ShipShipped SECA finalizes it, posting it, applying captured payments and sending it; revenue and receivable come at shipment. Proposed `release#ShipmentDraftInvoice` and `refund#OrderPayment` let a package reopen, or an order change, between pack and ship; after ship, changes go through returns and credit memos, so no InvoiceCorrection is needed for them. With the flag off Mantle finalizes at pack as before (impl-accounting §4, F25; D3; R-SB-17). |
| Bill match and holds | A match operator, in the one group `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_MATCH` that AP includes and buyers who match bills are given, applies matches through `MatchServices.apply#InvoiceMatch`, which writes OrderItemBilling. Only finance places and releases holds and approves; the placer cannot release. Match policy lives at MatchPolicies. Hold checks run on every payment path, not only payment runs: the hold guard is inside Mantle, at the one point where a payment is applied to a payable invoice, behind its flag, and the apply SECAs catch its refusal (impl-accounting §4; D4; R-XC-02, R-ACC-04, R-SB-16, R-SB-18, R-SB-19). Quantity under open inspection is excluded from matching (D21). The legacy match backfill is Accounting's, run by AP or a buyer with the match group from MatchPolicies or Purchasing's MatchExceptions (impl-accounting §4). |
| Invoice state guard | `InvoiceServices.change#InvoiceState` is the only invoice state guard; Projects `BillingServices.update#InvoiceStatus` calls it and the Projects UI is unchanged (D6; R-XC-04). |
| Customer Service order changes | Customer Service applies only cancel-remainder and short-pick substitution. Accounting's receiving action is `release#ShipmentDraftInvoice` for the invoice between pack and ship, returns and credit memos after ship, and `refund#OrderPayment` for captured excess (D9; impl-accounting §4). |
| Budget commitments | Accounting owns the proposed `mantle.other.budget.BudgetCommitment` and proposed `BudgetServices.check#Budget`, `reserve#Commitment`, `convert#Commitment` and `release#Commitment`. Purchasing's approval reserves, the PO converts, and bill approval (`approve#Payable`) converts to actual (D10; R-ACC-06, R-XC-37). |
| Returns | Accounting owns the proposed `ReturnSettlementServices.preview#Return` and `settle#Return` for customer and supplier returns, with the result codes and the supplier credit branch. Approval settles nothing, receipt goes through Warehouse `receive#ReturnItems`, and `receive#ReturnWithoutShipment` is not exposed (D11; R-ACC-28, R-SB-02 to R-SB-06, R-XC-27, R-XC-38). |
| Production cost to the GL | ProductionCostClose follows the production posting rule: output at the frozen standard, issues and receipts only through the existing hooks, absorption and variance at `post#CostClose`, which also closes the run. Manufacturing writes every cost event; labor events follow timesheet approval. The overhead and co-product policy lives only at CostingPolicies (D12; R-SA-01, R-SA-03, R-SA-09, R-SA-11, R-SA-18, R-ACC-09). This settles the cross-app question of valuation, overhead and co-product allocation policy. The default allocation is overhead at a rate per work-center hour, from WorkCenterRate's overhead component, times the run's actual setup and run hours, and co-products by quantity normalized to a common unit; CostingPolicies also offers fixed shares on the BOM's output lines and relative sales value for co-products, and a percentage of direct labor or none for overhead. Machine runtime with no effective rate is recorded unvalued and blocks the run's cost close until valued (impl-manufacturing §4; R-MFG-34). This settles the Open item on the default rule. |
| Subcontract charges | Components at the supplier stay company stock in an organization-owned vendor facility. Accounting allocates the charge: acceptance writes the accrual and the bill match the price variance. Service lines get no receipt-SECA bill (D14; R-SA-13). |
| Units and currencies | Accounting Currencies alone edits currency units and rates; Products Units excludes them. Posting stores the applied rate as a decimal (D17; R-ACC-21). |
| Foreign currency | Posting converts to the base currency and books realized FX on settlement (AC-19). Until AC-19 ships, finalizing or posting a document in another currency is refused, behind D18's flag, and Setup readiness says "single currency until AC-19" (D18; R-ACC-01). Rates are manual dated UomConversion rows with a CSV import, each marked with its source; with AC-19, `refresh#Rates` is a provider interface named in the organization's settings, with the European Central Bank's daily reference rates as the shipped provider, and a fetch proposes rates a finance user accepts before they are active (impl-accounting §4; AC-16). |
| Capability vocabulary | §1.1 maps every role label to a `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_*` group, and other apps' terms to the same groups (D22; R-ACC-15). |
| Recurring invoices | Order-based recurring billing stays on the OrderHeader recurrence and the `create_RecurringOrders` job; proposed InvoiceSchedule is only for invoice-only cadences (D24; R-ACC-13). |
| Party finance, identity and tax forms | The shared PaymentDetails, PartyIdentifications and TaxRegistrations forms show on Customer360 and Supplier360; a bank-detail change voids a pending payment-run approval. Supplier default terms live only on the proposed `SupplierProfile.settlementTermId`, which finance edits through Purchasing's `store#SupplierProfile` (D26; R-ACC-16, R-XC-10). SupplierProfile is effective-dated by organization and supplier, with `settlementTermId` and `selfBillingIndicator` its audit-logged finance fields (impl-accounting §4). |
| Context blocks follow the crosscut rows | The Customer360, Supplier360, OrderDetail, ShipmentDetail, EquipmentDetail and Product360 blocks use the crosscut Accounting rows' tabs (R-ACC-22, R-XC-25). Customer360's aging list, financial summary and Statement action are crosscut additions (R-XC-41, R-XC-42). Activities show on Customer360, Supplier360 and Collections (D25; R-XC-06). |
| Screen names and the Inventory area | `GlAccountDetail` is renamed `AccountDetail` at `Accounting/GeneralLedger/AccountDetail` (D27; R-ACC-37). InventoryValuation and ProductionCostClose move to `Accounting/Inventory/` (R-ACC-26). PeriodLocks, AssetClasses and BudgetControls stay in their own areas, beside the work they govern, as an exception to the `Settings/` rule of design-doc-guide §10. BudgetVariance stays in Reports. |
| Valuation corrections | InventoryValuation previews and posts revaluation (`post#Revaluation`), as value-only adjustments with ledger links. The raw rewrite services `update#ProductAcquireCost` and `update#AssetAcquireCost` are reserved to finance-admin data-repair actions with audit and an open-period check (R-ACC-02). |
| Posting guard and restricted services | The lock, period and idempotency guard runs inside `post#AcctgTrans`. `unpost#AcctgTrans`, `update#AcctgTransPosted`, `repost#*` and the Mantle REST mutators get no artifact authorization for BOSS_ACCOUNTING_* groups. `repost#AssetIssuance` posts a dated reversing delta instead of unposting (R-ACC-14; R-SA-02). A guard failure is split by source: a direct post is refused with the reason, and an automatic post from an operational event goes to the error journal with the failed guard named, listed and blocking close; an auto-poster that finds no account records a failure, not `AtrSuccess` (impl-accounting §4). |
| Merged research candidates | These candidates are merged, not separate screens: dashboard widgets into Home; credit memo and return credit into InvoiceDetail and ReturnDetail; debit notes into BillDetail and ReturnDetail; recurring bills into RecurringInvoices; payments to validate and refunds into Payments tabs and PaymentDetail; chart import into Setup; account ledger into the GeneralLedger report; the tax-on-document grid into InvoiceDetail; AR and AP aging summary and detail into Aging; payment gateways into PaymentMethods and Admin; numbering into DocumentSettings (R-ACC-27). |
| Gateway baseline forms | The six `Gateway/*` forms are handed on: EditPaymentGateway and FindPaymentGateway to Admin, EditShippingGateway and FindShippingGateway to Warehouse Carriers and Commerce. Their Designed-in cells stay blank for those files (R-ACC-27). |
| Services deliberately not called | `LedgerServices.post#GlJournal` counts a transaction diverted to the error journal as posted and marks the journal posted regardless (impl-accounting F17), and is replaced by the proposed `JournalServices.post#Batch`. `AssetAutoPostServices.calculateAndPost#AllFixedAssetDepreciations` posts without a preview and is replaced by DepreciationRunDetail. Their usl-inventory cells stay blank (R-ACC-27). |
| Reminder sender | Dunning runs are the only scheduled reminder sender. The Mantle `send_SalesInvoicePastDueEmails` job stays paused, and Setup readiness flags it (R-ACC-29). |
| Ledger dimensions | A ledger line carries product and asset; the transaction header carries the other party and the work effort. The first release adds proposed `AcctgTransEntry.facilityId` and `AcctgTransEntry.costCenterId` (decided Oct 28, 2026; AC-22; R-ACC-11). A cost centre is an internal organization Party, such as a department, independent of the GL account. AccountDetail sets, per organization, which dimensions an account requires, and posting refuses an entry that lacks one. JournalEntryDetail lines, ExpensePosting and PostingMappings carry the two dimensions; the invoice and payment auto-post services copy them from the source line. Purchases pass the cost centre from the request to the PO line, the bill line and the entry. Percentage distribution across cost centres is `later`. |
| Landed costs owner | Accounting owns landed-cost allocation at `Accounting/Payables/LandedCosts` (proposed `AssetBookServices.post#LandedCost` over a proposed LandedCostAllocation). It is in the first release (`new`, decided Oct 28, 2026) for any organization that pays freight or duty on stock purchases, because Purchasing reports landed cost as actual only after this allocation and Warehouse valuation reads it (R-ACC-10, R-PUR-18). |
| Scope labels | Home is `parity`, because it replaces OrgInternalSummary. Reconcile, unreconcile and no-reconcile stay as BankAccountDetail row actions, so manual reconciliation keeps parity while ReconciliationDetail is `new` (R-ACC-25). |
| Cash forecast | A cash forecast is left to Insights; Accounting shows cash by bank on Home and adds no forecast screen in the first release. |
| Root and organization filters | `BOSS_ACCOUNTING` is the root user group and artifact group. Its groups take `MANTLE_USER_ORG` and `MANTLE_PRIVATE_CONTACT`; `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_ADMIN` has all authz on the root, `MANTLE_ACTIVE_ORG` and `MANTLE_PRIVATE_CONTACT`. `AccessServices` checks every supplied organization and record; unfiltered child records are read only through services that check their parent's organization, and `GlAccount` stays global (§1; impl-accounting §4; impl-drawers-commons §4). |
| Mantle rule flags | A Mantle rule change is the one behavior, unless it would break Mantle's flow specs; then it is adopted by its own flag, off by default, an audit-logged `PartyAcctgPreference` field with a neutral name, listed with its reason in impl-accounting §4, and BOSS's demo organization turns it on. Today that is `postingGuardEnabled`; D2's receipt billing, D3's pack invoice and D11's return settlement get theirs when built (§1.4; impl-accounting §4, F27). |
| Operation record | CX-POSTING keeps one Mantle operation record keyed by `operationKey`, checked and written by each posting service in the posting's transaction (§18.1; impl-accounting §4). |
| Ledger reports and GL summaries | Reports read closed periods' GL summary rows, which close computes and stores, and sum open periods from posted entries at read time; `realTimeGlSummary` stays as each organization has it, and no report depends on it (§13; impl-accounting §4). |
| Self-approval | One audit-logged `PartyAcctgPreference` field, off by default, set only by `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_ADMIN`, covering every Accounting approval; a decision whose approver drafted the record is stamped self-approved (§1.1; impl-accounting §4). |
| Approvals by topic | Accounting's Approvals filters Commons Notifications by the approval topics it owns, passed by its mount, not by `appName`; a bill approval stays in Accounting's list whichever app sent it (§14 Approvals; impl-accounting §4). |
| Payment term discounts and installments | `SettlementTermLine` effective-dated rows, saved through `store#SettlementTerm`, and a per-invoice `InvoiceDueSchedule` written at issue, which aging, the workbenches, runs and `apply#Settlement` read; a discount taken within its date posts to the discount account (§15 PaymentTerms; impl-accounting §4; R-ACC-12, R-XC-53). This settles the Open item. |
| Product360 GL mappings | The Accounting context of Product360 adds a GL mappings pane over `ProductGlAccount` and `ProductCategoryGlAccount`, organization-scoped and edited by finance admin; PostingDefaults stays the bulk editor (§14 Product360; impl-accounting §4; R-ACC-22). This settles the Open item. |
| Project cost posting | `post#WorkEffortCost` posts approved project time from labor clearing to project cost, behind its flag; production time is left to Manufacturing (AC-07; impl-accounting §4). |
| Chart templates | Seeded template organizations on Mantle's one global chart, copied by `init#PartyAccountingConfiguration`; one template ships, and conflicting country charts are country packs (§15 Setup; impl-accounting §4). |
| Effective-dated policies and the audit log | SupplierProfile, InvoiceMatchPolicy, FixedAssetClass, BudgetControlPolicy and ProductionAllocationPolicy are effective-dated rows with audit-logged key fields; budget amounts are audit-logged and a budget revision is a time; a sent invoice and an approved budget store their PDFs; a budget's other parties are BudgetParty rows (impl-accounting §4; impl-manufacturing §4; impl-drawers-commons §4). |
| Scrap by reason | A count variance posts to the organization's `VarianceReasonGlAccount` for its reason, then for a scrap reason to the asset type's `scrapGlAccountId`, and otherwise as Mantle does (§15 PostingDefaults; impl-warehouse §4). |

## 20. Open

The default overhead and co-product allocation rule, payment term discounts and installments, and
Product360 GL mappings are decided (§19; impl-accounting §4, impl-manufacturing §4). The items
below are `later` (impl-accounting §7).

- **Country/book policy packs.** Recommended: activate local jurisdiction and accounting-policy
  adapters separately, each with versioned output and acceptance cases. The generic authority,
  statement and exchange screens remain as designed; no country-specific compliance claim is
  made by the base app. The first release ships the US 1099 data and local sales tax only. The
  packs name the features still missing, each `later`:
  - Cash-basis (payment-date) tax exigibility (R-ACC-18): an exigibility flag per TaxAuthority and
    organization; tax posts to a transition account and moves to payable on
    `post#PaymentApplication`; TaxStatement's basis becomes the payment date.
  - Withholding tax on supplier payments (R-ACC-19): the withheld amount as an active
    `mantle.account.payment.Deduction`, a rate on the corrected TaxAuthorityRate, and a statement
    through TaxStatement.
  - E-invoice networks and statutory filing formats, through ElectronicInvoices and AC-15.
- **Advanced finance implementation order.** Recommended: FX revaluation and simple deferrals
  before leases, recognition and intercompany/consolidation; retain the common reviewed
  AccountingPeriodRun contract so these later areas do not fork posting controls. FX revaluation
  comes only after base-currency posting and realized FX (AC-19), which are a first-release
  prerequisite (R-ACC-01).
- **Statement formats beyond BAI2/OFX/CSV.** Recommended: add a bank-specific adapter only when a
  deployment needs it, preserving import identity and line-level error reporting. Live feeds
  are integrations, not a prerequisite for the designed bank workflows. ISO 20022 camt.053, and
  then MT940, is the expected next adapter, so StatementImport's format enum and its FIT and
  source-row identity are designed for it now.
- **Posted-entry hash.** Recommended: `later`. A hash chain per organization and journal type over
  posted AcctgTrans, with a verification report, after the hard lock of AC-06 (R-ACC-32).
- **Inbound direct debit.** Recommended: `later`. Mandates, a collection batch file that reuses
  the NACHA outputs, and imported rejects, on PaymentRunDetail's pattern (R-ACC-33).


## P0–P3 implementation contracts — Oct 29, 2026

The implemented ownership split is native Mantle authorization/configuration/mutation and BOSS access context,
forms and approved preview presentation. See [AccountingImplementation](../docs/AccountingImplementation.md).
`AccountingServices`, `JournalServices`, `CloseServices`, `AccountServices`, `FinanceReportServices`, `SetupServices`,
`CurrencyServices` and `JournalContentServices` are in `mantle.ledger`. New services declare their response fields
and check permissions and organization scope independently of artifact authorization.

Invoice, bill and payment routes in P1 provide scoped lists, guarded drafts and read-only details. Their full
approval, delivery, settlement and gateway actions remain P4–P5. P2 includes both ledger and batch/template/file
work. Published templates are immutable versioned records; instantiation creates an independent unposted draft.
Manual journal reviews expire after ten minutes and fingerprint sources, entries, accounts, preferences, periods,
locks and exceptions. Posting uses the existing PostingOperation and rechecks under lock. P11 close execution and
P19 activation remain deferred.

ChartOfAccounts can assign an existing global chart account to the selected organization without exposing another
organization's balances. PostingDefaults follows the installed invoice resolver: product category, product,
asset-type profit/receipt accounts, then item type (including direction E); organization configuration includes
accounting parents. Other transaction kinds use their native party, instrument, payment, financial and type rules.
Its missing queue distinguishes generic invoice-item defaults from product overrides and includes error-journal
transactions. Native configuration writers refuse a change of posted currency, fiscal or costing meaning.

Rates have explicit dates and persisted sources; CSV rows commit independently with durable results. Payment
methods return masked identifiers. Active PaymentGatewayOrganization records are provisioned in Admin; finance
forms may select those bindings but cannot write gateway credentials or executable service configuration.
DocumentSettings retains Mantle numbering fields and issued identities and previews the approved standard layout.
PASS Billing/Supplier runtime remains P18; its mount, target, invitation, media, canonical URL and gateway CSP
contracts are documented in mr-pass/plan/design-forum.md. The test gateway in Mantle's `PaymentTestServices.xml`
answers pending and declined (P5, R2); P18 adds the portal-specific capability, gateway and remote-frontend integration coverage.

## P4–P5 implemented contracts

P4–P5 are built on Mantle's own services, after the review R2 in [impl-accounting](impl-accounting.md) removed what
they first built beside them; those services supersede the older writer, poller and BOSS service names in the tables
above. Invoices change state through `change#InvoiceState`, print and send through Mantle's templates, an
EmailTemplate and `send#Invoice`, and credit through `create#InvoiceCreditMemo`. Statements are today's open items,
aged as of a date. Settlement applies through `apply#InvoicePayment`, `apply#PaymentToPayment` and
`apply#InvoiceToInvoice`; payment state changes through `update#Payment`; gateway actions through the
`*#SinglePayment` services with an operation key; refunds through `create#RefundPayment`; a transfer is one payment.
Each review a user confirms is a `PaymentReview` row. Credentials and executable gateway configuration never reach the
app. The contracts are in [AccountingImplementation](../docs/AccountingImplementation.md). Deposits, bank sessions,
payable holds, later reports and the rest of P6–P21 remain planned.
