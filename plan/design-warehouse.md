# IronStone BOSS — Warehouse design

Oct 28, 2026 — draft; reviewed against research-warehouse.md, the reference apps and the other core designs ([review-core-apps.md](review-core-apps.md)); the existing invoice and return SECAs are named and decided (§15.2), return receipt moves to `receive#ReturnItems`, and subcontract dispatch, repack, scrap, lot generation and stock at date are added; brought in line with the plan decisions of [impl-warehouse.md](impl-warehouse.md) §4 and §6 (F9, F10, F13), impl-accounting §4 and impl-drawers-commons §4: organization filters and facility scope, effective-dated policy and template rows, `scan-input` and handheld density, the expiry gate, scrap by reason, the count schedule and ABC classes, PDF labels and the test carrier, the pack invoice finalized at ship, and the run's own lines; Nov 1, 2026 — consistency pass (built services and routes named as built)

IronStone Warehouse serves receiving clerks, pickers, packers, inventory controllers and warehouse
managers. Receiving, Inspection, Inventory, Counts, Transfers and requests, Picking, Packing and
shipping, Returns, Locations, Handheld, Reports and Settings form one operational app. A small
business can receive, hold, move, count, fulfill and return goods from this app alone, using the
shared records and authorized actions it mounts locally.

**Inputs.** [research-warehouse.md](research-warehouse.md) §1–§17; [design-crosscut.md](design-crosscut.md)
(the common contracts and canonical shared definitions); [design-doc-guide.md](design-doc-guide.md);
[style-guide.md](style-guide.md); [initial-design.md](initial-design.md)'s fixed decisions;
[design-drawers-commons.md](design-drawers-commons.md); [design-projects.md](design-projects.md);
[ss-inventory.md](ss-inventory.md) and [usl-inventory.md](usl-inventory.md).

**Source paths.** Moqui baseline paths below are relative to `runtime/components/addon/mr-marble/screen/SimpleScreens/`,
except `BasicHandheld/…`, which is under `runtime/components/addon/mr-marble/screen/`. Mantle paths are
relative to `runtime/components/addon/mr-mantle/`. Third-party paths resolve under `~/work/moquiwork/3p_other/`
using the research prefix table: Odoo under `odoo/`, ERPNext under `frappe/erpnext/`, Carbon under `carbon/`.
ridgecrest is not under `3p_other/`: its paths resolve under `~/work/moquiwork/ridgecrest/`.
The research's old `/home` checkout prefix is not required. References describe behavior; no third-party
source is copied. Inventory cells shorten baseline paths; §15 records their exact keys.

**Baseline before the build.** Before P0, Warehouse held only root/section placeholders; the operational
screens below were built in impl-warehouse P0–P18. The Commons shell, context, Chatter, files, request links and
Projects shared RequestDetail already existed. PhysicalInventoryCount and all four PI statuses were active.
`record#PhysicalInventoryQuantity` adjusted stock immediately, even when given a count-line ID; this design
introduced separate count entry and posting. AssetServices already read expiration dates for customer
newer-inventory/lot selection: the research's absolute claim otherwise was stale. A general expiry/quality posting gate was a required extension; its expiry part sits inside Mantle behind its WarehousePolicy flag (WH-EXPIRY). `CarrierServices.get#ShipmentRates`
was commented out, despite its research/inventory listing; shipment rating is now the adapter
`mantle.shipment.WarehouseTaskServices.get#ShipmentRates` over the active gateway rate interfaces.
`get#InventoryProjectedInfo` is an indexed projection: display its
as-of/freshness and unavailable-search state, never substitute zero demand, and revalidate against
transactional sources before supply conversion.

**Service notation.** Fully qualified existing services are verified against active XML. `entity` means
an authorized entity read or non-posting master-data create/update through the
`ironstone.warehouse.AccessServices` checks (§1), never a bare entity form. InventoryCountServices,
WarehouseTaskServices, PutawayServices, WarehousePolicyServices and TraceabilityServices are built in Mantle.
Any service still described as proposed, such as DeliveryServices and ExternalStockServices, is a required
addition, not an existing API.
Stock/financial actions always pass the crosscut posting guard, even where a form names the existing
service it ultimately uses. New wrappers must not change that service's established semantics. A new refusal
inside a Mantle service, such as the expiry gate, sits behind its own flag, off by default, kept with its
owner's settings (impl-accounting §4).

## 1. Shell

Root `screen/Warehouse.xml`, launcher title **IronStone Warehouse**, icon `sym_o_warehouse`,
root user group and artifact group `BOSS_WAREHOUSE`. The root calls `mantle.party.PartyServices.setup#UserOrganizationInfo`
and resolves authorized facilities/owners. `app` below means Warehouse access plus record visibility.
Narrow action capabilities are role grants: receive, inspect, issue, move, count, count reviewer,
adjust, pick, pick supervisor, pack, ship, dispatch, shipping manager, stock planner, warehouse manager,
quality manager, facility admin and integration operator. A user may hold several; the server checks the
capability and scope for every action. Read-only users can navigate and export visible operational data;
they cannot post through a URL.

Facility scope follows Moqui's organization filters (impl-warehouse §4, impl-drawers-commons §4). The Warehouse
groups take `MANTLE_USER_ORG` and `MANTLE_PRIVATE_CONTACT`; the first's Facility filter, `ownerPartyId` in
`filterOrgIds`, is the facility scope: the facilities of the active organization when one is set, or else of every organization
the user belongs to with its direct children. A user in no organization has an empty `filterOrgIds`, and the filter's
`IN ()` matches nothing, so they work in no facility; `AccessServices` reads that empty list the same way, never as
"every facility" (impl-warehouse F35). Vendor-custody facilities are organization-owned, so they are in
scope; facilities owned by a third party that hold the organization's stock are later. A facility that names no owner of its
own (a room loaded without one) is its nearest owning ancestor's in the facility, location and room-feature saves
(FacilityScope.js `ownsFacility`; Nov 11, 2026, impl-maintenance P2's review, an owner contract), as Maintenance reads it; an
owned facility is its owner's, and the stock guards read the facility's own owner. The admin group
`BOSS_WAREHOUSE_ADMIN` has all authz on the root with `MANTLE_ACTIVE_ORG` and `MANTLE_PRIVATE_CONTACT`; that set
has no Facility filter, so an admin works in every facility of every organization. `_NA_` products stay
readable, since `MANTLE_USER_ORG`'s product filters admit them. Nothing filters Asset, AssetDetail or
PhysicalInventory, or filters by facility, so Warehouse reads and writes them only through
`ironstone.warehouse.AccessServices`, which checks the user's organizations, the facility and owner, and the
capability before the Mantle service runs. The Warehouse groups get no artifact authorization for the raw
Mantle stock services or their REST paths.

Each capability is one user group in the crosscut §1 capability table (`BOSS_<APP>_<CAPABILITY>`).
The Roles column of §2 uses the capability names on the left.

| Capability | Group | What it allows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| receive | `BOSS_WAREHOUSE_RECEIVE` | Receive, ReturnReceipt, AdHocReceipt and the receipt actions of ShipmentDetail mounts |
| inspect | `BOSS_WAREHOUSE_INSPECT` | Save readings and submit inspections |
| issue | `BOSS_WAREHOUSE_ISSUE` | Issue, return unused and receive output in MaterialIssueReceipt |
| move | `BOSS_WAREHOUSE_MOVE` | Putaway, Move, Repack, ContainerDetail moves and PickLocationMoves |
| count | `BOSS_WAREHOUSE_COUNT` | Create counts and enter observations |
| count reviewer | `BOSS_WAREHOUSE_COUNT_REVIEWER` | Review count variance and resolve conflicts |
| adjust | `BOSS_WAREHOUSE_ADJUST` | Post Adjustments, Scrap and approved count variances |
| pick | `BOSS_WAREHOUSE_PICK` | Pick, short pick and put back |
| pick supervisor | `BOSS_WAREHOUSE_PICK_SUPERVISOR` | Create waves and assign people and equipment to loads |
| pack | `BOSS_WAREHOUSE_PACK` | Pack, complete pack and reopen a package |
| ship | `BOSS_WAREHOUSE_SHIP` | Rate, label, ship and record delivery |
| dispatch | `BOSS_WAREHOUSE_DISPATCH` | Plan and run delivery trips (later) |
| shipping manager | `BOSS_WAREHOUSE_SHIPPING_MANAGER` | Edit Carriers and BoxTypes |
| stock planner | `BOSS_WAREHOUSE_STOCK_PLANNER` | Start a SupplyPlanning run and convert transfer suggestions |
| warehouse manager | `BOSS_WAREHOUSE_MANAGER` | Edit StockPolicies, ReservationPolicies, AssetPools and ProductFacility policy |
| quality manager | `BOSS_WAREHOUSE_QUALITY_MANAGER` | Verify and dispose inspections, edit InspectionTemplates and extend expiry |
| facility admin | `BOSS_WAREHOUSE_FACILITY_ADMIN` | Edit FacilityDetail, PutawayRules and printer bindings |
| integration operator | `BOSS_WAREHOUSE_INTEGRATION_OPERATOR` | Review and apply ExternalStockSync batches |

Financial-read is not a Warehouse grant. It is Accounting's `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_READ` group
(design-accounting §1), and every cost, value or invoice amount on a Warehouse screen checks it. Customer
Service's W capability is receive plus inspect here, with quality manager for disposition.

Menu to depth two (detail and task paths remain hidden until opened):

- Home → Home.
- Receiving → Receipts, Putaway, Supplier360 from the selected supplier.
- Inspection → Inspections, InspectionTemplates.
- Inventory → Availability, Assets, Lots, Containers, Movements, Traceability (TraceabilityGraph later); Product360 from a product.
- Counts → Counts (with a link to CountVariance under Reports).
- Transfers → Transfers, Move, Repack, StockRequests, SupplyPlanning.
- Picking → Picklists, CreatePicklists, PickLocationMoves.
- Shipping → Shipments, Pack, PackageTracking, DeliveryTrips (later).
- Returns → Returns.
- Locations → Facilities, PutawayRules, Capacity (later), Carriers, BoxTypes, Printers.
- Handheld → HandheldHome, HandheldReceive, HandheldPutaway, HandheldPick, HandheldPack, HandheldMove,
  HandheldCount, HandheldPickFace (menu titles Home, Receive, Putaway, Pick, Pack, Move, Count, Pick face).
- Reports → Reports, StockAtDate, InventoryValuation, CountVariance, OperationsHistory.
- Settings → Settings, StockPolicies, ReservationPolicies, AssetPools, ExternalStockSync (later).

Home's ready/waiting/late/backorder counts open the same task lists with filters. Facility selection
persists as a user preference but never overrides authorization. Cost/value columns require financial-read
permission; selection/export endpoints apply the same field restrictions. Records expose canonical IDs,
not screen-local aliases, so Chatter and files do not split across mounts.

Shell providers: palette types for shipments, returns, lots/assets, containers, counts and picklists;
quick create for receipt, transfer, count and stock request; Today sources for assigned pick, count and
inspection work: pick loads (WepShipmentShip) on which the user has a WorkEffortParty row, open from an earlier day
(the shell's Today already shows a load as an event on its start day), counts whose assignee the user is, and
inspections whose inspector the user is. Putaway has no assignment; its queue is on Home (impl-warehouse F42);
notifications for receipt exceptions, shortage/short pick, inspection decision, failed
posting and due counts. Due counts come from the count schedule (StockPolicies, WH-COUNT). Provider queries are organization/facility/owner scoped. F2 focuses scan only in
a handheld task; Enter resolves input, and a separate visible confirmation commits a movement. No global
shortcut silently dispatches stock. Existing shell components are reused (WH-SHELL).

## 2. Screens

Each row is a screen, including a contextual mount; one-form dialogs remain in their host's Forms table.
`parity` replaces baseline functionality, `new` is an essential first-release addition, and `later` remains
fully designed for a subsequent build. Shared section numbers refer to design-crosscut unless stated. Since the
Warehouse build (Oct 31, 2026) Impl names the phase of impl-warehouse that built the screen, or the §7 item it waits for.

## 3. Home

### Home

**Layout.** landing; operation cards first, exceptions and my work next, modest KPI strip last. Quantity KPIs are visible to operators; valuation requires financial-read authority.

**Forms.**

| Form | Kind | Purpose | Highlighted fields | Widgets of note | Services | Derived from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| QueueFilters | find | Select the operating scope | facility, owner, my work, date horizon | facility selector | — | Shipping/dashboard FacilitySummary; Odoo Inventory Overview |

**Actions.** Open queue is primary on each card. Quick create offers receipt, transfer, count and stock request only when the underlying create permission is present. No stock mutation occurs from a KPI. The queues leave out drop shipments (ShpTpDrop), which no Warehouse task handles. Cards carry counts only; later trend panels register with [Insights](design-insights.md#6-report-catalog-and-domain-metrics) over the same authorized facility/owner measures, with source watermarks and reconciled stock semantics. The framework chart engine exists; the Warehouse trend adapters remain application work.

**Devices.** phone. HandheldHome is the separate handheld screen.

**Actions.** Create opens ReceiptDetail. Receive selected opens a review of each independent shipment; it never silently assumes every expected line arrived.

For a PO part, NewReceipt calls `ensure#PurchaseReceipt` (orderId, orderPartSeqId, facilityId, items and quantities, expected date, operationKey). It returns the open ShpTpPurchase shipment of that part in Input or Scheduled status, or creates one, so a part has one open receipt. Purchasing's "Expected receipt (ASN)" action calls the same service. For a customer return, NewReceipt opens the return shipment that the `ReturnApprovedProcess` SECA created at approval; it never creates a second one. A transfer receipt is the destination leg of its TransferShipmentDetail.

### ReceiptDetail (Context passed)

**Context passed.** Mount `Shared/ShipmentDetail` at `Warehouse/Receiving/ReceiptDetail`; `appRoot=Warehouse`. crosscut §3.8.

| Tabs or panes shown | Filters fixed | Action set | Emphasis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Overview, Items and sources, Receipts, Tracking, Inspection, Files, Chatter | incoming to an authorized facility; purchase/transfer/sales-return type | receive, inspect, backorder or close remainder (`close#ReceiptRemainder`), print; edit draft header/parties; cancel unposted only | accepted, rejected and held quantities, source quantity remaining and lot/serial identity |

The close-remainder action is in crosscut §3.8's receipt row (§18, D28). Subcontract dispatch and its return use SubcontractShipmentDetail, not this mount.

### Receive

**Forms.**

| Form | Kind | Purpose | Highlighted fields | Widgets of note | Services | Derived from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| ReceiveLine | single | Record accepted and rejected quantities without losing source links | entered quantity and unit, accepted, rejected, reason, lot, serial, expiry, destination, owner | scan-input; tracked-quantity breakdown | `mantle.shipment.ShipmentServices.receive#ShipmentProduct` through WH-POST guard; pack scans through Products' `mantle.product.ProductServices.resolve#ScannedProduct` | Shipment/ShipmentDetail/ReceiveItem ReceiveForm |
| GenerateTracking | dialog | Create serial or lot identities for many units in one step | first serial or lot (or the TrackingPolicy pattern), count, quantity per lot, expiry, uniqueness preview | preview list with duplicate flags | `mantle.shipment.WarehouseTaskServices.generate#TrackingIdentities`, then the guarded `receive#ShipmentProduct` loop under one operation identity | Odoo `odoo/addons/stock/models/stock_move.py` serial generation; ERPNext Item serial_no_series |
| AdHocReceipt | single | Receive stock without an order when explicitly authorized | product, quantity, UOM, owner, lot/serial, facility/location, reason, cost reference | scan-input; tracking breakdown | `mantle.product.AssetServices.receive#Asset` through WH-POST guard | Asset/Asset/FindSummary ReceiveAssetForm; BasicHandheld/ReceiveAsset ReceiveAssetForm |
| ReceiveRemaining | dialog | Finish a complete receipt or an explicit short receipt | remaining source lines, actual quantities, close or backorder choice, reason | summary and exception list | `mantle.shipment.WarehouseTaskServices.close#ReceiptRemainder`; `mantle.shipment.ShipmentServices.receive#EntireShipment` only as "Receive all as expected" with explicit confirmation | Odoo backorder confirmation; Carbon ReceiptPostModal |

**Actions.** Receive line posts one validated line atomically, then advances. Inspect opens the shared inspection with the source fixed. Finish offers Leave open, Create remaining receipt or Close remainder with authorized reason; only the quantities actually received are posted. Serial-tracked quantities require unique serials and a matching count.

AdHocReceipt is the one ad hoc receipt form in BOSS. Crosscut §3.9 links to it, and MaterialIssueReceipt opens it with its purpose fixed instead of defining its own.

Generate tracking fills the serial or lot of many units from a first value or the TrackingPolicy pattern (StockPolicies). The preview names every duplicate, and nothing posts until the user confirms. Each generated Asset then posts through the same guarded `receive#ShipmentProduct` call as a typed line. Manufacturing's ReceiveOutput uses the same `generate#TrackingIdentities` service.

When the effective TrackingPolicy or a published InspectionTemplate applicability requires inspection, Receive posts the accepted quantity with statusId AstQuarantine into an FltQuarantine (or receiving) location. It calls the `create#Inspection` in the same operation. Held quantity is the open-inspection quantity. Match-eligible quantity is AssetReceipt.quantityAccepted minus the held quantity. A dock rejection is AssetReceipt.quantityRejected, with no stock. The shared read `mantle.product.QualityServices.get#SourceInspectionStatus` (crosscut §3.19) gives matching and planning the held quantity, and bill matching leaves it out.

Receive keeps the unit the receiver entered. It writes the AssetReceipt fields enteredQuantity, enteredQuantityUomId and appliedConversionFactor (crosscut CX-POSTING). A PO line in OrderItem.quantityUomId converts to the stock unit at receipt. A scanned pack product either converts to its base product through the `resolve#ScannedProduct` or is stocked as the pack; Repack splits it later.

Finish never uses `receive#EntireShipment` for a short receipt, because that service accepts every unit not yet handled, including units that never arrived. Close remainder and Create remaining receipt call `close#ReceiptRemainder` (shipmentId, choice close or backorder, reason, operationKey). For close it calls Purchasing's `mantle.order.OrderServices.close#PurchaseRemainders` for the ShpTpPurchase sources: per item, the quantity less what was cancelled and received (accepted and rejected), recorded through `cancel#OrderItem` with an explicit cancelQuantity (design-purchasing ClosePurchaseOrders). For backorder it calls `ensure#PurchaseReceipt` for the remainder and `mantle.shipment.ShipmentServices.update#ShipmentItem` on this shipment. Only then does it call `mantle.shipment.ShipmentServices.deliver#Shipment`.

Delivery sets ShipDelivered, which runs the `ShipmentIncomingDeliveredCreateInvoices` SECA. Under the bill policy of crosscut §4.4, behind D2's flag (impl-accounting §4; off by default, so plain Mantle keeps its behavior), it creates a bill only for a supplier marked self-billing, for the accepted quantity only. Otherwise Accounting takes in the supplier's bill (`mantle.account.InvoiceServices.import#Bill`). Each posted receipt or correction queues Accounting's `mantle.account.InvoiceMatchServices.queue#MatchReevaluation` through Mantle's AssetReceiptQueueMatchReevaluation EECA, beside InvoiceItem's; both exist (Accounting P7).

As built (impl-warehouse P7, §4): the receive guard is `WarehouseTaskServices.receive#ShipmentStock`, AdHocReceipt's
`receive#AdHocStock`, and "Receive all as expected" `receive#ExpectedShipment`, which accepts each remainder through the
guard and delivers, refusing lot- or serial-tracked lines; `receive#EntireShipment` is not called. Purchasing's close runs
inside `close#ReceiptRemainder` (`PurchaseRemainders.js`), and a closed order's commitments are released by the internal
`BudgetServices.release#ClosedSourceCommitments`.

**Navigation.** ReceiptDetail → Receive → Putaway; returned stock opens the same task with return eligibility fixed, and its lines post through `receive#ReturnItems` (ReturnReceipt).

**States.** A duplicate/uncertain submission retrieves its operation result before another receipt. Failed rows remain editable; successful rows remain locked with receipt IDs. A rejected quantity does not become usable stock. A PO revision changes the open receipt through `WarehouseTaskServices.adjust#ExpectedReceipt`, called by Purchasing in the same transaction. It sets each open ShpTpPurchase source to the new remaining quantity and never below the received quantity. While a receive operation holds the source it returns ReceiptInProgress, and the revision waits. As built (impl-purchasing P9, F-P9-1, F-P9-5): the adjustment also takes the order held by its revision, the revision locks the open receipts before it writes, and ReceiptInProgress is Purchasing's: a receipt posted since the change was reviewed fails the revision by name.

**Devices.** handheld and phone; one product, scan, quantities, destination and confirmation, with 48 px controls and persistent focus. Keyboard entry is equivalent in terminal.

**Actions.** Open inspection or assign inspector. Bulk reassignment is per inspection with named results; bulk acceptance is unavailable because each result needs its own readings/disposition.

**Views.** list, board by inspection status; moving a card assigns work only, never accepts a lot.

**Needs.** WH-QUALITY

### QualityInspection (Context passed)

**Context passed.** Mount `Shared/QualityInspection` at `Warehouse/QualityInspection`; `appRoot=Warehouse`. crosscut §3.19.

| Tabs or panes shown | Filters fixed | Action set | Emphasis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Header, Readings, Result, Disposition, History (with samples and evidence) | incoming/outgoing/returns for authorized facilities | save readings; submit; verify/accept/reject under separate roles; release, quarantine, return or scrap through the stock guard | sample evidence and quantity by disposition |

Release sets AstAvailable, which runs the existing `AssetStatusAvailableReservations` SECA (`mantle.product.AssetServices.reserve#IncreasedAsset`). That SECA gives the lot to waiting reservations by reservation priority. So the `mantle.product.QualityServices.dispose#Inspection` first reserves stock that has customer demand provenance (RequirementSupply or OrderItemWorkEffort) to that order item through `mantle.product.AssetServices.reserve#AssetForOrderItem`, in the same disposition transaction. A disposition also queues Accounting's `queue#MatchReevaluation`.

As built (impl-warehouse P8, §4): QualityInspection is mounted at `Warehouse/QualityInspection` (the root, hidden from the
menu), not under the Inspection area, so every Warehouse user opens it (F195); dispositions are
`QualityInspectionDisposition` records, Release taking the accepted quantity and the others the rejected; the demand peg is
the inspection's `demandOrderId` (a run's OrderItemWorkEffort, or given); a receipt needs inspection on step 3, the tracking
policy's `inspectionRequired` or a published receipt template.

### InspectionTemplates (Context passed)

**Context passed.** Mount `Shared/InspectionTemplates` at `Warehouse/Inspection/InspectionTemplates`; `appRoot=Warehouse`. crosscut §3.19.

| Tabs or panes shown | Filters fixed | Action set | Emphasis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Templates, Characteristics, Sampling, Applicability, Revision history | organization; warehouse applicability shown without hiding Manufacturing reuse | create draft, change, publish, retire; a published item is never edited in place | incoming and return checks shared with in-process/final inspection |

Templates change by effective date, not by version records (impl-warehouse §4, impl-drawers-commons §4). The
InspectionTemplateItem rows are effective-dated with audit-logged key fields; publishing stamps their
from date, and a change to a published item ends it and starts a new row. An inspection keeps its template and
the time it was created and reads the items as of then. Revision history reads the rows and the audit log, and
the template prints as of a date.

## 6. Inventory

### Availability (Context passed)

**Context passed.** Mount `Shared/InventoryAvailability` at `Warehouse/Inventory/Availability`; `appRoot=Warehouse`. crosscut §3.7.

| Tabs or panes shown | Filters fixed | Action set | Emphasis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

The Policy pane also edits the product's TrackingPolicy exception (StockPolicies ProductTrackingExceptions). Crosscut §3.7 has the Movements tab and the later Age column (§18, D28). Bulk Relocate takes a destination and a reason for the selected rows and returns a result per row through WH-POST; CSV mass moves are later.

### MaterialIssueReceipt (Context passed)

**Context passed.** Mount `Shared/MaterialIssueReceipt` at `Warehouse/Inventory/MaterialIssueReceipt`;
`appRoot=Warehouse`; crosscut §3.9.

| Tabs or panes shown | Filters fixed | Action set | Emphasis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Source, Material lines, Tracking, Posted issues/receipts, Unused returns, Files | authorized facility; work effort or shipment assembly | issue/receive/return with stock authority; ad hoc receipt opens Receive AdHocReceipt with its purpose fixed; pick-assembly produce/consume using existing ManufacturingServices with its source fixed | physical quantity, lot/serial, stock UOM and source identity; financial postings follow Accounting policy |

Manufacturing owns the production services this mount runs; Warehouse executes them, and builds them with the
runs and their lines to Manufacturing's contracts (impl-warehouse §4).

- A run has its own lines (impl-warehouse §4): its material and output lines are `mantle.work.production.ProductionRunLine` rows with a stable line ID, the source `bomItemId`, product, quantity and unit and operation, written at create from the BOM and routing as of the chosen date and frozen at release. The run's revision, release time and frozen standard cost are audit-logged fields of the run.
- Issue goes through Manufacturing's `mantle.work.ProductionServices.issue#ProductionMaterial`, over `mantle.product.AssetServices.issue#AssetToWorkEffort`. Each issue creates a new AssetIssuance per operation and material line and never merges into an earlier one. The guard checks the asset's statusId, so quarantined stock is not issued. It refuses an asset whose owner is not the run's owner (WorkEffort.ownerPartyId, the organization).
- Stock movements carry the run's workEffortId, never an operation child's. The run line goes in the fields AssetIssuance.productionMaterialLineId and AssetReceipt.productionOutputLineId, with an operationWorkEffortId on both.
- Return unused goes through `ProductionServices.return#UnusedMaterial`. It posts a new receipt fact through `mantle.product.AssetServices.receive#Asset` (workEffortId of the run, the original acquireCost, AssetReceipt.sourceAssetIssuanceId). It never calls `mantle.product.AssetServices.cancel#AssetIssuance`, and nothing updates a posted production issuance. An update would run the `AssetIssuanceGlRePost` SECA, which unposts and deletes the posted entry.
- Receive output goes through `ProductionServices.receive#ProductionOutput`, with acquireCost the run's frozen standard unit cost (with no approved standard, the issued cost to date ÷ quantity, marked provisional); GenerateTracking (Receive) creates its lots or serials.
- Subcontract output is received here through `ProductionServices.receive#SubcontractOutput` (see SubcontractShipmentDetail).
- Pick-assembly kits use the Kit components that Products maintains (`ProductServices.store#KitComponent`, PtPickAssembly only). The kit receipt carries acquireCost = the sum of issued component cost ÷ kit quantity. `produce#AvailableAssemblies` takes no acquireCost and receives the kit with none (AtrNoAcquireCost). It runs inside `pack#ShipmentAssemblyComponent` after each component pack, which `pack#ShipmentProductScan` also calls, so a guard around one caller cannot pass the cost. An organization flag, `PartyAcctgPreference.kitCostFromComponents` (off by default, like D2's and D3's flags), is read inside `produce#AvailableAssemblies`: the kit's cost is the issued component cost (each issuance's quantity × its source asset's acquireCost; AssetIssuance has no cost field) ÷ kit quantity, passed to `receive#Asset`, or to `update#AssetAndReceipt`, which takes acquireCost and reposts, when a later pack adds to the kit asset (impl-warehouse F41). The `AssetReceiptGlPost` SECA then relieves WIP, and issuing the kit to the shipment posts its cost of goods sold.

### Product360 (Context passed)

**Context passed.** Mount `Shared/Product360` at `Warehouse/Inventory/Product360`; `appRoot=Warehouse`. crosscut §3.5.

Crosscut §3.5 has the Replenishment tab (§18, D28). It shows the facility levels; its planning suggestions come with the shared supply plan (WH-PLAN).

**Actions.** Move, Record adjustment and Scrap lead to tasks; Scrap opens the Adjustments Scrap dialog with this asset fixed. No direct edit of quantity, physical location, hold release, owner transfer or acquisition cost; each uses its guarded business action. Serial/lot changes after posting require a documented correction, not relabeling history. Acquisition-cost changes are Accounting's (§18 Decided).

**Actions.** Preview then confirm Post. Exact scope is required; blank location/lot means None unless the user explicitly chooses an aggregate authorized scope (Any). None and Any are the location's and the lot's, as Mantle's physical inventory services express them; the owner is the facility owner unless given, and pool and status are a value or Any (impl-warehouse §4, F156). Zero is a count, blank is no entry. Closed-period changes fail; negative changes respect facility policy and reservations. Backdated adjustments recalculate the historical scope and show the posting effect.

Scrap is the one path for free stock that leaves as waste; AssetDetail, Move and the Lots expiry list open it with the stock fixed. It may first move the stock to an FltMorgue location, then calls `record#PhysicalInventoryChange` with the reasons InVrScrap or InVrExpired (or the existing InVrDamaged). The PhysicalInventory it creates carries the scrapIndicator, so Counts and CountVariance leave it out. Scrap posts by its reason (impl-warehouse §4): `post#PhysicalInventoryVariance` reads the organization's `VarianceReasonGlAccount` row for the reason, then, for a scrap reason with none, the asset type's AssetTypeGlAccount.scrapGlAccountId (design-accounting AC-07), and otherwise found or shrinkage by sign as before. With nothing mapped it posts as Mantle does, so it needs no flag; Accounting builds the poster change and seeds the scrap reasons' rows. Scrap of components issued to a run, or of held output in a run, is Manufacturing's `record#ProductionLoss`, not this dialog.

**States.** Concurrent movements invalidate the preview and require a fresh review; duplicate operation returns the original adjustment.

**Actions.** Create, correct metadata and print label; expiry shortening immediately affects validation. Expired and near-expiry rows offer Scrap (Adjustments). Extending expiry requires a reason and quality-manager permission; it does not itself release quarantine.

**Actions.** Move validates every content line then commits the whole container move atomically. Incompatible owners/statuses/capacity reject the move; independently selected containers return separate results. Container attachment never silently changes physical location. Mantle's `AssetLocationFromContainer` entity ECA copies a container's facility and location onto an asset whose containerId is set, and `ContainerAssetLocation` moves every asset of a container whose location changes (impl-warehouse F9). So `attach#AssetToContainer` refuses an asset that is away from its container, and `move#Container` moves the contents through the WH-POST guard. Outbound boxes remain ShipmentPackage records.

## 7. Counts

### Counts

**Forms.**

| Form | Kind | Purpose | Highlighted fields | Widgets of note | Services | Derived from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CountFind | find | Find counts and assigned work | facility, assignee, status, date, mode | saved finds | — | Asset/PhysicalInventory/FindPhysicalInventory PhysicalInventoryList |
| CountList | list, read | See progress and named posting failures | count, facility, mode, status, counted/total, due, assignee | status/progress | entity | FindPhysicalInventory PhysicalInventoryList |
| NewCount | dialog | Create a scoped counting document | facility, location scope, products, mode, blind, assignee, planned date, comments | scope preview | `mantle.product.InventoryCountServices.create#Count` | Carbon InventoryCountForm |

**Actions.** Create opens CountDetail. Clone creates a new scope without copying counted quantities or posted results. As built (impl-warehouse P18), the same form is also the quick-create screen `Warehouse/NewCount`, under the root for the count group.

The Due saved find lists `InventoryCountServices.find#DueCounts`, and NewCount accepts a due scope. Each location, or product at a facility, is due at the earlier of its last count plus the schedule's frequency and the schedule's annual date; a location that reaches zero stock is due for zero confirmation (StockPolicies CountSchedule). Ad hoc dues are the short-pick recount and Request a count: on selected Assets or Availability rows it opens NewCount with that scope, a date, an assignee and the blind flag.

**Views.** list, calendar by planned date.

### CountDetail

**Forms.**

**Actions.** Start snapshots scope and expected quantities then enters PIInProgress. Submit locks count entries and moves to PIInValidation; reviewer may request recount (back to progress with history). Post belongs to CountReview. PIComplete requires every in-scope line posted, zero-variance confirmed or explicitly skipped with reason; an unresolved failed line prevents completion.

**States.** Blind counters receive neither expected quantities nor variance/derived filters from the server until authorized review. Reviewed/posted scope is immutable.

### CountEntry

**Forms.**

**Actions.** Save count never calls record#PhysicalInventoryQuantity. Skip requires a reason; unexpected stock creates a reviewed extra scope line with exact identity, not a silent widening of the aggregate. Repeated scans increment only when scan-quantity mode is explicitly enabled.

### CountReview

**Forms.**

| PostCount | list, bulk | Apply approved independent line variances | line IDs, reason, effective date, operation ID, reviewed version | posting preview and named result list | `mantle.product.InventoryCountServices.post#Count` | Carbon InventoryCount post; existing immediate variance service behind the guard |

**Actions.** Default conflict action is Recount. A reviewer may carry the observed variance forward after examining all intervening movements; never overwrite current quantity with a stale absolute count. Post requires confirmation and rechecks each reviewed version under lock. Each disjoint stock bucket commits atomically; failed lines name the identity and continue with other independent buckets. Retry skips the recorded successes.

`post#Count` follows the posting rules of the existing `AssetDetailPhysicalVarianceGlPost` SECA, which it keeps. It passes the count's own physicalInventoryId and an open-period effective date. It adds the approved deltas up per exact asset first, because the SECA posts one transaction per asset per PhysicalInventory and silently skips a second delta. The variance is valued at the asset's acquireCost, a positive delta goes to the oldest asset by receivedDate, and the account follows the reason's `VarianceReasonGlAccount` row where the organization maps one, and otherwise the sign of the delta (Adjustments Scrap). The PostCount preview shows that valuation basis. Scrap and expiry use Adjustments Scrap, not count variance.

**States.** Blank lines stay uncounted. Conflicts and financial-period errors block their affected line. Different count lines targeting the same stock bucket are reconciled as one dependent group to prevent double adjustment.

## 8. Transfers and requests

### Transfers

**Forms.**

| Form | Kind | Purpose | Highlighted fields | Widgets of note | Services | Derived from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TransferFind | find | Find transfers and subcontract dispatches | origin, destination, status, due, custody at supplier, run or PO item | saved finds | — | Shipment/FindShipment ShipmentList |
| TransferList | list, read | See outstanding ship and receipt steps | shipment, origin, destination, shipped, received, due, status | two-leg progress | entity | Shipment/FindShipment ShipmentList |
| NewTransfer | dialog | Create the facility transfer and source lines | origin, destination, products, quantities, dates, reference | authorized facility selectors | `mantle.shipment.WarehouseTaskServices.create#Transfer` (ShpTpTransfer) | Shipment/FindShipment NewTransferShipment |

**Actions.** Create → TransferShipmentDetail. Shipment and receipt are separate physical events; in-transit quantity is not counted as usable at the destination. A row whose destination is a vendor-custody facility opens SubcontractShipmentDetail; the "custody at supplier" filter lists the company stock now held by suppliers.

A transfer keeps the stock's value. The ShpTpTransfer issue posts to `AssetTypeGlAccount.transferGlAccountId`, and Setup readiness requires that account, because without it the issue posts to cost of goods sold. The receipt at the destination does not copy acquireCost by itself, so the WH-POST guard copies the source issuance's acquireCost and owner into the destination receipt. The remaining quantity of a transfer line is what its issuances sent less what its receipts accepted and rejected, each summed on its own: `ShipmentItemDetail` multiplies the two when both exist, so neither it nor `receive#EntireShipment` is used for a transfer (impl-warehouse F37).

**As built** (impl-warehouse P15): NewTransfer calls the guarded `mantle.shipment.WarehouseTaskServices.create#Transfer` over `create#Shipment`; the origin sends named stock with `issue#TransferStock` (P11's `pick#ShipmentStock` picks a transfer line, which has no reservation) and ships with `ship#Transfer`; the destination receives in parts with `receive#TransferStock`, each receipt a piece of one issuance at its cost, owner, lot and serial (`AssetReceipt.sourceAssetIssuanceId`). A transfer is between facilities of one owner. A subcontract dispatch is a transfer that names the production work and service order item (`Shipment.subcontract*`), going by `dispatch#SubcontractStock` (`move#Asset`) when it has no in-transit step.

**Needs.** WH-POST, WH-SUBCONTRACT

### TransferShipmentDetail (Context passed)

**Context passed.** Mount `Shared/ShipmentDetail` at `Warehouse/Transfers/TransferShipmentDetail`; `appRoot=Warehouse`. crosscut §3.8.

| Tabs or panes shown | Filters fixed | Action set | Emphasis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Overview, Items, Origin pick/ship, Transit, Destination receive, Files, Chatter | ShpTpTransfer; explicit origin and destination facilities | reserve/pick/ship at origin; receive/inspect/putaway at destination; cancel only remaining unposted quantity | in-transit quantities and partial receipts |

Crosscut §3.8's transfer row has the Transit pane (§18, D28).

### SubcontractShipmentDetail (Context passed)

**Context passed.** Mount `Shared/ShipmentDetail` at `Warehouse/Transfers/SubcontractShipmentDetail`; `appRoot=Warehouse`. crosscut §3.8.

| Tabs or panes shown | Filters fixed | Action set | Emphasis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Overview, Items and sources, Origin pick/ship, Custody at supplier, Returned components, Output receipt, Files, Chatter | dispatch to an organization-owned vendor-custody facility; run, operation and service PO item keys fixed | pick and ship components; take back unused components; receive output through MaterialIssueReceipt; cancel unposted quantity only | company-owned stock in a supplier's custody |

Owners of the subcontract steps: Manufacturing creates the requirement (proposed `ProductionServices.request#SubcontractService`) and owns SubcontractDetail. Purchasing places the service PO and records service acceptance (`mantle.order.OrderServices.accept#ServiceItem`). Warehouse dispatches the components and takes back what returns. Accounting allocates the supplier's charge.

- The vendor-custody facility has Facility.ownerPartyId = the organization. The supplier is a FacilityParty with the role Custodian. A supplier-owned facility is never used, because `receive#Asset` takes the owner from the facility and would make the supplier the owner.
- Asset.ownerPartyId never changes on dispatch.
- With no in-transit step, dispatch is `mantle.product.AssetServices.move#Asset` to the vendor facility, which keeps acquireCost and owner and posts nothing. With an in-transit step, dispatch is a ShpTpTransfer shipment, and WH-POST carries cost and owner as for any transfer (Transfers).
- Output comes back through Manufacturing's `ProductionServices.receive#SubcontractOutput`, which Warehouse runs from this screen or from MaterialIssueReceipt. In one transaction it issues the run's material lines from the vendor-custody facility to the run, receives the output with the run's workEffortId and no transfer shipmentId (AstQuarantine when an inspection applies, acquireCost from the run's cost basis), calls the `accept#ServiceItem` with the receipt and inspection evidence, and writes the cost events.
- The output is never received on the service PO line, and service lines get no bill from the receipt SECA. A logistics document for the inbound leg, if wanted, is a ShpTpIncoming shipment.

### Move

**Forms.**

| Form | Kind | Purpose | Highlighted fields | Widgets of note | Services | Derived from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| RecentMoves | list, read | Confirm posted work and safe retry result | time, stock identity, from, to, quantity, operation result | result link | entity | Asset/Asset/SelectAsset RecentMoveForm and RecentContainerMoveForm |

**Actions.** Confirm move; product-level moves show the selected asset allocation first. Cross-facility movement opens Transfers rather than changing location in place. Moving reserved stock preserves reservation links or rejects the move.

Move also stages components for a production run in the first release. Manufacturing's Components "Stage" action opens Move with the run and its products fixed, and the move posts through the same WH-POST guard over `move#Asset`. Issue then posts from wherever the stock is. Staging is a Warehouse move; WIP is a ledger and status idea, not a location.

### Repack

**Forms.**

**Actions.** Unpack turns a pack asset into its contained base units; repack turns base units into packs. The pack direction is Products': ProductAssoc.productId is the pack product, toProductId is the contained base product, and quantity is the contained base quantity (design-products §10). `repack#Asset` runs inside an organization-owned WepAssembling WorkEffort. It issues the source to that effort, which posts to WIP, and receives the target with acquireCost = issued cost ÷ target quantity, which relieves WIP. The two postings net to zero through the existing `AssetIssuanceGlPost` and `AssetReceiptGlPost` SECAs. The lot carries over, and the receipt links back to the source issuance. Either both movements post or neither does.

**Actions.** Create opens RequestDetail. Approval creates or links a Requirement with provenance (RequirementRequestItem plus the proposed RequirementSupply of crosscut §3.20); it does not duplicate a purchase request or directly move stock. As built (impl-warehouse P15): approval is `mantle.request.RequestServices.approve#InventoryRequest` under the stock policy permission, an approved RqTpInventory Requirement per item and the request in progress (Request has no approved status); RequirementSupply waits for CX-PLANNING.

**Source.** research-warehouse §15 and §17; implemented Shared/RequestDetail and RequestRecord.

**Needs.** WH-REQUEST, WH-PLAN

### RequestDetail (Context passed)

**Context passed.** Mount `Shared/RequestDetail` at `Warehouse/Transfers/RequestDetail`; `appRoot=Warehouse`. crosscut §3.11; design-projects §6.

| Tabs or panes shown | Filters fixed | Action set | Emphasis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Overview, Items, Supply, Conversation, Work, Files | RqtInventory; requester and destination facilities | edit/submit; approve under stock authority; allocate/transfer; create linked buy/make requirement; cancel unfulfilled remainder | requested versus supplied quantities without duplicate demand |

The Supply tab and its actions are crosscut §3.11's InventoryRequestProgress panel (§18, D28). It reads `mantle.request.RequestServices.get#InventoryRequestProgress` (request item; requested, approved, allocated, transferred and received quantity; Requirement and RequirementSupply links). Allocate calls `mantle.shipment.WarehouseTaskServices.allocate#InventoryRequest`, which creates a ShpTpTransfer through `create#Shipment` or a guarded `move#Asset` within one facility. `complete#RequestFromWork` does nothing for RqtInventory; its progress comes from these movement facts. The design-projects §6 Warehouse row is narrower (no Work or Files, no requirement creation) and should match this row.

### SupplyPlanning (Context passed)

**Context passed.** Mount `Shared/SupplyPlanning` at `Warehouse/Transfers/SupplyPlanning`; `appRoot=Warehouse`. crosscut §3.20.

| Tabs or panes shown | Filters fixed | Action set | Emphasis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Demand, Available/open supply, Suggestions, Conversion results | authorized facility; transfer and inventory-request demand emphasized | recalculate; convert authorized transfer suggestions; route buys/makes through the same requirement | one net-needs result shared with Purchasing and Manufacturing |

There is one current PlanningRun per organization and facility set. Any planner starts it from the Purchasing, Manufacturing or Warehouse mount through proposed `mantle.product.SupplyPlanningServices.run#SupplyPlan`, or the scheduled job runs it; the schedule is the shared proposed `store#PlanSchedule`. A new run supersedes unconverted suggestions. Purchasing converts buy suggestions, Manufacturing make and Warehouse transfer. Warehouse users see transfer and internal-stock needs; converting them needs the stock planner capability. Suggestion quantities are in the stock unit. The plan works at facility level, so pick-face shortages are PickLocationMoves' Below minimum mode, not suggestions here. Held quantity under open inspection shows as a pending-release supply line with its inspection due date, left out of netting unless the organization's plan schedule nets held quantity due within the lead time (§18).

**Actions.** Pick is primary; Unpick reverses only unshipped pick movement and restores the same allocation. Short does not decrement on-hand: it creates an exception/recount. Reallocation or a separately reviewed adjustment resolves the mismatch. Substitution requires an authorized source-order change; scanner input cannot change the product.

A short pick writes a ShipmentPickException (exceptionId, shipmentItemSourceId, assetId and locationSeqId, quantityShort and its unit, reasonEnumId, resolutionEnumId, physicalInventoryId of a recount, operationKey, actor and time). ShipmentItemSource.quantityNotHandled stays what Mantle means by it, the quantity still to handle, so the exception record is what shows a line as Short.

Customer Service decides order changes; Pick carries them out. A substitution on a short pick is approved and applied by Customer Service through proposed `mantle.order.OrderChangeServices.apply#OrderChange` (substitution kind), with candidates from the product's PatEquivalent and PatReplacement associations. Pick then picks the changed source line. A cancelled balance (cancel kind, through `cancel#OrderItem` and `mantle.product.AssetServices.reduce#AssetReservation`) flags the affected ShipmentItemSource. Pick shows those lines in Put back, which reverses the pick to the original location; nothing changes in stock until the picker confirms. Lines already packed are put back from Pack.

### ShipmentDetail (Context passed)

**Context passed.** Mount `Shared/ShipmentDetail` at `Warehouse/Shipping/ShipmentDetail`; `appRoot=Warehouse`. crosscut §3.8.

| Tabs or panes shown | Filters fixed | Action set | Emphasis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Overview, Items/sources, Reservations, Packages, Routes/tracking, Returns, Files, Chatter | outgoing shipment from authorized facility | reserve, pick, pack, ship, deliver, return, labels and print; metadata/parties before posting; quantities under guards | physical progress and source eligibility; payments only with financial-read |

Warehouse mounts ShipmentDetail six times: ReceiptDetail, TransferShipmentDetail, SubcontractShipmentDetail, ShipmentDetail, ReturnReceipt and SupplierReturnShipment; crosscut §3.8 has a Warehouse row per mount (§18, D28).

| ReopenPackage | dialog | Reopen a completed package, or put back stock of a reduced line, before shipment | shipment, package, source lines, reason, operation identity, pack invoice state | invoice-state warning; confirm before any change | `mantle.account.InvoiceServices.release#ShipmentDraftInvoice`, then `mantle.shipment.ShipmentServices.unpack#ShipmentItemIssuance` | ShipmentPackages ShipmentPackageContentList unpack; Odoo unpack |

**Actions.** Pack scan is primary during packing; Close package then Complete pack. A completed package can be reopened before shipment with audit. Pick assemblies preserve their component/output links through shared MaterialIssueReceipt; unused components are returned or packed by the existing assembly action, not discarded. ShipmentPackage does not become a nested storage Container.

Complete pack creates the sales invoice. `complete#ShipmentPack` calls `pack#Shipment`, and ShipPacked runs the `ShipmentOutgoingPackedCreateInvoices` SECA, which BOSS keeps. It creates the sales invoice through `mantle.account.InvoiceServices.create#SalesShipmentInvoices` in its own transaction. Behind D3's flag (impl-accounting §4) the invoice stays InvoiceInProcess, with no payments applied, until the shipment ships: a ShipShipped SECA finalizes it, posting it, applying captured payments and sending it. With the flag off Mantle finalizes it at pack as before. Complete pack never requests or prints carrier labels; label purchase happens only in Ship Labels, so the provider request keeps its durable identity.

After pack, Mantle refuses to unpack an issuance whose source has an invoice. Reopen package therefore first calls Accounting's `release#ShipmentDraftInvoice` (shipmentId, reason, operationKey), which checks the Accounting permission inside. Behind D3's flag the pack invoice is still InvoiceInProcess until ship, so between pack and ship the release succeeds. For a pack invoice in InvoiceInProcess it removes the shipment's lines and OrderItemBilling and clears ShipmentItemSource.invoiceId. A captured payment returns to unapplied, or Accounting refunds it through `mantle.account.PaymentServices.refund#OrderPayment` when the change reduces the order. Then `unpack#ShipmentItemIssuance` returns the stock. A finalized invoice cannot be released this way, and the package stays closed; after shipment, changes go through returns and credit memos. The same steps put back packed stock of a line that Customer Service reduced.

Kit components come from Products' Kit components editor (`mantle.product.ProductServices.store#KitComponent` over PatMfgBom, PtPickAssembly only, built by Products P2). The kit receipt carries acquireCost = the sum of issued component cost ÷ kit quantity, set inside `produce#AvailableAssemblies` (MaterialIssueReceipt; impl-warehouse F41), so a shipped kit posts its cost of goods sold and leaves no WIP.

### Ship

**Forms.**

**Actions.** Get rates, choose method, request labels, then Ship; requesting a label does not imply shipment. Provider calls run with durable request identity outside the stock transaction; timeout queries provider state before purchase retry. A per-package label failure does not duplicate successful labels, and blocks dispatch where required. Refund label does not reverse physical shipment. Dispatch requires tracking totals, inspection release and unexpired eligible lots.

A small business without a carrier API can still ship. RateOptions includes a local-rules provider, an adapter over the logic of the existing `mantle.shipment.CarrierServices.get#OrderShippingRateLocal`. For a method with no gateway, ManualCarrier records the tracking code and the actual cost, and ShipConfirm accepts that manual tracking code in place of a label. ShipShipped runs the existing `ShipmentShippedSendEmail` SECA, which BOSS keeps; it sends the store email only when the shipment has a store. Behind D3's flag, ShipShipped also finalizes the pack invoice (Pack).

**Actions.** Refresh selected packages with per-shipment results; record delivery requires ship role and evidence. Tracking reads never silently invoke re-shipment. A package marked delivered runs the existing `ShipmentPackageDeliveredCheckShipment` SECA, which sets the shipment delivered once every package is; `ShipmentDeliveredSentEmail` then sends the store email. BOSS keeps both. PackageTracking handles outgoing shipments only; incoming and return deliveries go through Receive and ReturnReceipt.

**Actions.** Release plan, start trip, record stop, finish. These move the proposed Delivery.statusId through the proposed statuses DlvPlanned, DlvReleased, DlvInTransit and DlvCompleted (or DlvCancelled); Delivery has no status or driver today. Each delivery updates its own shipment atomically; one refused stop does not roll back other completed stops.

### OrderDetail (Context passed)

**Context passed.** Mount `Shared/OrderDetail` at `Warehouse/Orders/OrderDetail`; `appRoot=Warehouse`. crosscut §3.6.

| Tabs or panes shown | Filters fixed | Action set | Emphasis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Header, Items, Fulfillment (availability, shipments, returns), History, Files, Chatter; money only with financial-read | eligible sales/purchase parts involving authorized facilities | reserve; create/add shipment; pick/pack/ship/receive through tasks; open existing returns; commercial edits require order role | source-line outstanding and shipment progress |

An order on hold (OrderHold, with the OrderHold type Credit, Change or Purchase) gets no new shipments, because Mantle already blocks shipment creation by status; Warehouse queues need no extra filter, and a Warehouse user cannot release a hold. Reservations made when the order was placed stay while it is held.

### InvoiceDetail (Context passed)

**Context passed.** Mount `Shared/InvoiceDetail` at `Warehouse/Orders/InvoiceDetail` (as built in impl-warehouse P13, beside
OrderDetail); `appRoot=Warehouse`;
crosscut §3.16. This hidden mount is reached from ShipmentDetail/ReturnDetail financial links, so a permitted
Warehouse user need not open the Accounting app just to inspect the linked document.

| Tabs or panes shown | Filters fixed | Action set | Emphasis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Header, Source lines, Receipts/shipments, Posting status; amounts/payments only with financial-read | invoice linked to an authorized shipment/return; organization and financial visibility revalidated | read and permitted print/export; no approval, posting, payment, credit or refund in the Warehouse context | invoice provenance and physical quantity reconciliation; financial mutations use an explicitly authorized specialist context |

## 11. Returns

### Returns

**Forms.**

| Form | Kind | Purpose | Highlighted fields | Widgets of note | Services | Derived from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| NewReturn | dialog | Record a proposed return when Warehouse is the intake desk | direction, source order, party, reason, expected date | returnable-item lookup | `mantle.order.ReturnServices.create#Return`, `mantle.order.ReturnServices.create#ReturnFromOrder`; Purchasing's `find#ReturnableReceipts` for a supplier return (SupplierReturnShipment) | Return/FindReturn CreateReturn and CreateSupplierReturn |

**Actions.** Create opens ReturnDetail; authorization remains a separate permission. Receive only approved eligible lines; unexpected or unapproved goods may be physically quarantined through an authorized ad hoc receipt linked to a Request case, never falsely treated as authorized return receipt.

Customer Service authorizes a customer return through its proposed `mantle.order.ReturnPolicyServices.authorize#Return`, which settles nothing. Behind D11's flag (impl-accounting §4), the `ReturnApprovedProcess` SECA then only creates the return shipment (`mantle.order.ReturnServices.create#ReturnShipment`), without its `process#ReturnItemResponses` call. Warehouse receives the goods (ReturnReceipt), and Accounting settles after inspection through `mantle.order.ReturnServices.settle#Return`.

**Source.** research-warehouse §9; Return/FindReturn.

**Needs.** WH-RETURN, WH-QUALITY, WH-POST, WH-RECORD-HOSTS

### ReturnDetail (Context passed)

**Context passed.** Mount `Shared/ReturnDetail` at `Warehouse/Returns/ReturnDetail`; `appRoot=Warehouse`. crosscut §3.18.

| Tabs or panes shown | Filters fixed | Action set | Emphasis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Overview, Eligible items, Shipments/receipts, Inspection/disposition, Settlement (read), Files, Chatter | customer or supplier return; authorized organization | create return shipment; receive/dispose or pick/ship supplier return; authorization/credit require their separate rights | actual arrived/shipped stock and reasons; financial values permission-filtered |

The Settlement tab shows Accounting's `mantle.order.ReturnServices.preview#ReturnSettlement` and `settle#Return` results read-only; Warehouse never settles. `mantle.order.ReturnServices.receive#ReturnWithoutShipment` is not offered: a physical receipt without a carrier uses ReturnReceipt against the return shipment that already exists, and a receiptless credit is Accounting's `settle#Return` with receiptless=true. Files on a return use the ReturnContent host (WH-RECORD-HOSTS).

### ReturnReceipt (Context passed)

**Context passed.** Mount `Shared/ShipmentDetail` at `Warehouse/Returns/ReturnReceipt`; `appRoot=Warehouse`. crosscut §3.8.

| Tabs or panes shown | Filters fixed | Action set | Emphasis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Overview, Return items, Tracking, Receipts, Inspection/disposition, Files | ShpTpSalesReturn; ReturnItem source fixed | receive actual serials/lots through `receive#ReturnItems`; quarantine; inspect and release; link credit status read-only | eligible returned quantity and provenance |

Return receipt settles nothing. It calls `mantle.shipment.WarehouseTaskServices.receive#ReturnItems` (Warehouse's contract, which Accounting builds with return settlement; impl-accounting §4), which replaces the `ShipmentDeliveredReturnReceive` and `ReturnReceivedProcess` SECAs on this path. For each line it records the quantity that physically arrived, accepted and rejected (quarantined) alike, and sets ReturnItem.receivedQuantity. It does not change returnQuantity and does not process item responses, so a second box or units rejected at the dock can still be received and credited against the RMA. An item becomes ReturnReceived when its received quantity equals the authorized quantity, or when a return authorizer closes the remainder. The ReturnHeader reaches ReturnReceived when every authorized item is physically handled, and ReturnCompleted only when every item's response is complete (`mantle.order.ReturnServices.complete#ReturnItem`), which Accounting's `settle#Return` sets. Settlement progress is read from ReturnItemBilling, not a new status. Settlement happens only after inspection and disposition.

As built (impl-warehouse P14): ReturnReceipt calls `receive#ReturnItems` with an operation key, which runs it on the posting guard: the lot and serial rules, every accepted unit as AstQuarantine into a quarantine location, and an inspection (QisReturn) of each accepted receipt, whose disposition releases the return's hold; the RMA receiving slip prints from it.

The return label: Customer Service's "Issue return label" action calls `mantle.shipment.WarehouseTaskServices.request#ReturnLabel` (returnId). It finds the return shipment, adds its package and route segment, and requests the label through WH-LABEL with an operation identity. Whether each gateway accepts a label from the customer's address is unverified. A customer return shipment has no store and comes from the customer, so the gateway is found only when its route segment names one; the vendor organization's default gateway for its return shipments is still to add, and a label needs the package's weight and unit (impl-customer-service F-P9-4). In Customer Service's context (CustomerService/Returns/QualityInspection, F38) a customer return's inspection is submitted and disposed by the borrowed W capability without the Warehouse root (ironstone.customerservice.ReturnServices.check#ReturnInspection); verification stays a quality verifier's, and Release and Scrap are the dispositions a customer return uses, Return to customer the third, which links the customer communication without changing the stock (impl-customer-service P9).

### SupplierReturnShipment (Context passed)

**Context passed.** Mount `Shared/ShipmentDetail` at `Warehouse/Returns/SupplierReturnShipment`; `appRoot=Warehouse`. crosscut §3.8.

| Tabs or panes shown | Filters fixed | Action set | Emphasis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Overview, Return items, Pick/pack, Carrier/tracking, Files | ShpTpPurchaseReturn; authorized ReturnItem source fixed | pick eligible return stock, pack, ship, labels; financial debit handled in Accounting context | outbound supplier-return chain |

Rejected or quarantined stock, the usual supplier-return case, cannot be reserved, because reservation selects AstAvailable assets only. So under disposition authority this mount issues the specific asset linked to the ReturnItem's AssetReceipt and lot from its quarantine location through `mantle.product.AssetServices.issue#AnyAssetForShipmentItemSource`. The keys are returnId and returnItemSeqId, assetReceiptId and assetId; Purchasing's `mantle.order.ReturnServices.find#ReturnableReceipts`, with PUR-RETURN's link from a ReturnItem to the AssetReceipt and asset it returns, gives the returnable receipts and lots: the accepted plus quarantined quantity less earlier supplier returns, locked per receipt and lot (impl-warehouse §4). When the ShpTpPurchaseReturn ships, `mantle.shipment.WarehouseTaskServices.ship#SupplierReturn` moves the ReturnItems to ReturnShipped. As built (impl-warehouse P14): `issue#SupplierReturnStock` issues the named asset through `issue#AnyAssetForShipmentItemSource`'s `assetId`, held stock only as far as its Return to supplier dispositions cover, lowering their inspection's held quantity; the supplier-return slip prints from it. Accounting's `settle#Return` then creates the supplier credit or debit note for the billed portion and sets ReturnCompleted.

**Actions.** Create/open FacilityDetail. Parent changes reject cycles; closing a location with stock or open work requires an explicit relocation plan. A location closes by an audit-logged `FacilityLocation.thruDate`; FacilityLocation has no status or end date today. The open work that refuses the close, each named: an inventory asset there with stock on hand or available-to-promise not zero (a depleted asset stays AstAvailable at zero and does not block), a non-inventory asset (equipment) there that has not left: not AstDelivered or AstDeactivated and with no `actualEndOfLife` (Accounting P12's disposal sets that date; Asset has no disposed status), a container there, a reservation not issued on an asset there (an open pick reserves its stock), a count line there on a count not posted or cancelled, and a ProductFacilityLocation or putaway rule naming it (impl-warehouse F43). A closed location is refused as a destination by the receive, move and putaway guards (`receive#Asset` and `move#Asset` do not read thruDate) and left out of location pickers.

**Shared maps (proposed, CX-MAPS):** add **View map** for the facility's readable address/coordinates using
[crosscut §3.32](design-crosscut.md#332-maps-and-record-location-dialogs). The same dialog is used by EquipmentDetail
and authorized origin/destination address blocks in receiving, shipping and transfers. Shipment/order snapshots
stay the source of transaction locations; a newer party address does not replace them. Postal fallback is labeled
approximate, and a warehouse bin's aisle/section/level is not a geographic point. Location selection follows the
owner's edit/change workflow and never causes a stock transfer or custody change.

Facility box-type assignment (crosscut FacilityPackaging) and printer binding (crosscut FacilityPrinters) live only here; BoxTypes and Printers link to them instead of defining their own forms. ProductFacility and ProductFacilityLocation rows are written through `store#ProductFacilityPolicy` (StockPolicies).

| CarrierTest | dialog | Validate addresses/rates against a test shipment | shipment, provider, method, test mode | explicit test indicator | `mantle.shipment.CarrierServices.validate#PostalAddress`, `mantle.shipment.WarehouseTaskServices.get#ShipmentRates` | Odoo carrier configuration |

**Actions.** Save method/binding, test rate/address; credentials are edited only through Admin authority. As built (impl-warehouse
P13): the methods and bindings take the shared `SHIPPING_CARRIER_EDIT` permission (the shipping manager), since carrier setup is
every organization's. Carriers is the one editor of CarrierShipmentMethod and the ShippingGatewayConfig bindings (crosscut §5). Commerce mounts the same records read-only and binds ProductStoreShipOption itself; a store grant is not required for carrier setup. A method with no gateway uses the local-rules rate and the manual carrier path of Ship.

Specs, demos and CarrierTest use Mantle's test carrier `mantle.shipment.carrier.TestGatewayServices` (impl-warehouse §4), a seeded ShippingGatewayConfig that implements every carrier interface deterministically: rates by weight and a zone table, a PDF label with a tracking number, refund, tracking and address validation. Reserved ship-to postal codes set off a timeout (the label exists when asked later), a refused label and an invalid address. It keeps its own record of the labels it issued, so ask-before-retry and refunds check something real. Real carriers are later gateways.

**Actions.** Test only; each row opens FacilityDetail's Printers tab, where facility admins edit the binding. A print failure leaves the already posted stock result intact and offers reprint of the same document, never repost.

The printers themselves are `moqui.basic.print.NetworkPrinter` records configured and test-printed in Admin Connections (a connection kind, review Z4); Warehouse only binds a configured printer to a facility and purpose, and links to Admin to add or fix one. FacilityPrinter has only facilityId, printerPurposeEnumId and networkPrinterId today. Copies and dates are fields added in WH-LABEL. Labels are PDF only in the first release; ZPL, with a format field, is later (§18). The seeded purposes cover container and package labels and picking, packing and shipment documents; lot labels, location labels and count sheets have their own purposes (WH-LABEL).

## 14. Reports and settings

**Insights registration (impl-insights P4, Nov 7, 2026).** StockAtDate, OperationsHistory and CountVariance are
`ironstone.insights.ReportCatalogEntry` rows (`Warehouse.*`) read by their routes' screen authorization; `Warehouse.OnHand`
(over `get#InventoryProjectedInfo` and the inventory dataset) and `Warehouse.StockAtDate` (over `get#InventoryAtDate`) are
snapshot metrics, never summed across dates, physical quantity apart from Accounting's valuation.

**Insights attention (impl-insights P5, Nov 7, 2026; F29).** Home's Receiving queue (`HomeServices.get#Home`, the selected
facility; waiting and late, late as its overdue part) is the `ironstone.insights.AttentionProvider` row `Warehouse.Receiving`,
opening the receipts with that facility;
the other queues wait for a check that each counts its list's query.

### Reports

**Forms.**

| Form | Kind | Purpose | Highlighted fields | Widgets of note | Services | Derived from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ReportIndex | list, read | List saved operational views and monetary links | report, purpose, date basis, latest run | descriptive links | entity/saved finds | ERPNext Stock workspace report cards |

**Actions.** Stock by location → InventoryAvailability; stock at date → StockAtDate; movements → Movements; availability/forecast → InventoryAvailability Projected; traceability → Traceability; count variance → CountVariance; history → OperationsHistory. Valuation opens the Accounting-owned InventoryValuation in this app with financial-read capability; opening the Accounting app is optional. Quantity reports remain complete without financial access.

**Source.** research-warehouse §13; ERPNext Stock workspace.

**Needs.** WH-REPORT

**Report services (Nov 1, 2026; review R-INS-06).** The reports reuse Mantle's built
`mantle.product.InventoryReportServices` rather than new queries where they fit: `run#StockTransactions`
for Movements' ledger slice and its export, `get#InventoryProjectedInfo` for InventoryAvailability's
projected view, and Accounting's `run#InventoryValuation` behind the mounted InventoryValuation.
StockAtDate's `get#InventoryAtDate` (built P17) belongs in the same service file. Warehouse registers
these reports with the Insights catalog as their owner, and Insights cites the same services.

### StockAtDate

**Layout.** report; the stock on hand at a past cut-off, kept apart from today's available quantity and from future promises. Warehouse owns this report, physically `Shared/StockAtDate.xml` as registered in [crosscut §3.26](design-crosscut.md#326-stock-at-date); Customer Service mounts it at its own path with its context.

**Forms.**

| Form | Kind | Purpose | Highlighted fields | Widgets of note | Services | Derived from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| StockDateFind | find | Choose the historical cut-off and scope | product/variant, facility, location, lot/serial, owner, effective timestamp and time zone, unit | date/time selector | — | Dolibarr `htdocs/product/stock/stockatdate.php` |
| StockHistory | list, read | Explain the quantity at the cut-off | opening, receipts, issues, adjustments, effective and recorded dates, closing, source link, completeness | tabular timeline; incomplete-history flag | `mantle.product.InventoryReportServices.get#InventoryAtDate` (built, Warehouse P17) | Dolibarr stockatdate.php; ERPNext `erpnext/stock/report/stock_balance/` (date range) |

**Actions.** Export and open source. No quantity change, cost display or promise action. History from before migration is labeled incomplete, not shown as zero.

`get#InventoryAtDate` (built P17) reads the AssetDetail ledger by effective date, with facility, location, lot and owner scope. It is owner-aware now, so later owner storage-fee billing can read dated owner snapshots from it. It is the one service for stock at date; Customer Service's StockAtDate mount calls it through this screen.

**Devices.** Terminal uses the same rows and cut-off.

**Source.** research-warehouse §13; design-customer-service StockAtDate; Dolibarr stockatdate.php.

**Needs.** WH-REPORT

### InventoryValuation (Context passed)

**Context passed.** Mount the [Accounting-owned report](design-accounting.md#inventoryvaluation)
at `Warehouse/Reports/InventoryValuation`, fixing authorized organization/facility and optional
product/lot/as-of filters. Financial-read exposes source cost, inventory/WIP/GL and variance;
revaluation controls require separate financial mutation authority. The report uses Accounting's
same forms and services, with no Accounting launcher grant required. Unauthorized users receive
quantity-only operational reports without monetary values or hidden financial payloads.

| Tabs or panes shown | Filters fixed | Action set | Emphasis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Same authorized report with facility/product drill-down | operational facility/product/as-of within financial visibility | report/export with financial-read; mutation only with separate finance capability | physical-to-value evidence |

Accounting's `mantle.product.InventoryReportServices.run#InventoryValuation` also lists the stock movements whose posting result is AtrNoAcquireCost or AtrNoAcctgPreference, and WIP by production run, so Warehouse can find the receipts that carried no cost. Revaluation and the baseline bulk cost correction post through Accounting's `mantle.ledger.AssetBookServices.post#Revaluation`, never from a Warehouse screen.

### CountVariance

**Actions.** Open CountReview; export excludes values hidden from the role. No quantities from active blind counts are returned to counters.

### StockPolicies

**Forms.**

| Form | Kind | Purpose | Highlighted fields | Widgets of note | Services | Derived from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OperationPolicy | single | Configure receipt, dispatch and count controls | receipt/delivery steps, default locations, over-receipt/ship tolerance, backorder choice, blind count, auto-print | scope inheritance and source | `mantle.facility.WarehousePolicyServices.store#OperationPolicy` | Odoo operation type settings; ERPNext Stock Settings |
| TrackingPolicy | single | Set tracking and expiry requirements | lot creation, serial required, serial/lot pattern, near-expiry days, expiry block (the expiry gate's flag, off by default), minimum shelf life | effective-source display | `mantle.facility.WarehousePolicyServices.store#TrackingPolicy` | Carbon inventory settings; ERPNext Stock Settings |
| ProductTrackingExceptions | list, editable rows | Set product-level tracking and shelf-life exceptions | product, facility (optional), lot required, serial required, serial/lot pattern, shelf-life days, near-expiry days, minimum remaining shelf life | product lookup; effective-source display | `store#TrackingPolicy` with product scope | ERPNext Item (has_batch_no, has_serial_no, shelf_life_in_days); Carbon item tracking |
| PolicyPreview | display | Explain effective policy for a source document | organization, facility, store override, product exceptions, permission limits | read-only resolution trace | `mantle.facility.WarehousePolicyServices.resolve#WarehousePolicy` | Odoo per-operation defaults |
| CountSchedule | list, editable rows | Set when locations and products come due for counting | scope (organization, facility, location type, area or location, product category, ABC class), kind (periodic every N days, annual on a month and day, zero confirmation), count mode (full, cycle or spot), blind default, assignee, from and thru dates | effective-source display | entity `mantle.facility.CountSchedule` | Odoo location count frequency and company annual count date; OCA stock_cycle_count (zero confirmation) |

**Actions.** Save a new effective-dated row: a change ends the current row and starts the next, with its key fields audit-logged (impl-drawers-commons §4). Over-receipt and over-shipment tolerances default to zero; an approved exception never exceeds the source contract without the corresponding authorized source change. With the expiry gate on (WH-EXPIRY), reservation skips expired stock and names a shortfall, and sales and production issue refuse an expired asset with its date; move to quarantine, return to supplier and disposal remain possible under explicit disposition authority. Near-expiry warnings show dates. An override cannot bypass quality hold, statutory/organization prohibition or financial-period locks. Policy changes apply at posting revalidation and never rewrite history.

Receipt and delivery steps choose default locations and the Home queues that show; there is no route engine.

| Steps | Receipt | Delivery |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Receive posts to the resolved putaway destination | Ship issues from stock; pack is optional |
| 2 | Receive posts to an FltReceiving location, and Putaway queues it | Pick to an FltStaging location, then Ship |
| 3 | Receive posts to FltQuarantine, then inspection, then Putaway | Pick, Pack, Ship |

TrackingPolicy has organization, facility and product scope. The product exceptions are the same records that Products and the Availability Policy pane show at Product360/Stock; Warehouse owns the form and `store#TrackingPolicy`, and no Product fields are added. The serial/lot pattern feeds Receive's GenerateTracking.

**Product facility policy contract.** All ProductFacility and ProductFacilityLocation writes go through one `mantle.facility.FacilityServices.store#ProductFacilityPolicy`, whose contract Warehouse owns. Purchasing ReorderRules, Products' stock policy, FacilityDetail and the Availability Policy pane call it instead of writing the entities. It takes productId and facilityId with minimumStock, reorderQuantity and daysToShip on ProductFacility (plus maximumStock and reorderMethodEnumId for Purchasing's min/max item, and the audit-logged abcClassEnumId over a new `AbcClass` enumeration seeded A, B and C, set by hand; impl-warehouse §4), and locationSeqId with minimumStock and moveQuantity on ProductFacilityLocation. It checks warehouse-manager or stock-planner authority for the facility, refuses a location of another facility and a negative level, and records who changed what. The planning schedule is not here; it is the shared SupplyPlanning setting `store#PlanSchedule`.

### ReservationPolicies

**Forms.**

| Form | Kind | Purpose | Highlighted fields | Widgets of note | Services | Derived from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FacilityReservation | single | Provide defaults without requiring a store | facility, reservation order, automatic timing, partial allocation, require stock | effective-source badge | `mantle.facility.WarehousePolicyServices.store#ReservationPolicy` | ProductStore reservation fields; Odoo operation reservation method |
| StoreReservation | single | Edit a permitted store override over the same records Commerce uses; the one editor of these fields (X16) | store, inventory facility, reservationOrderEnumId, reservationAutoEnumId, requireInventory | store lookup scoped to organization | `mantle.facility.WarehousePolicyServices.update#StoreReservation` (built P3; field-scoped over ProductStore) | existing ProductStore configuration |
| ReservationCheck | dialog | Review and repair eligible reservation discrepancies | facility, product scope, affected orders, preview results | named result list | `mantle.product.AssetServices.check#FacilityReservations` guarded and previewed | existing AssetServices reservation checks |

The facility default holds the reservation order and automatic timing, which Mantle's reservation reads where the store leaves them unset; partial allocation and require stock are not in it (impl-warehouse §4, F99). Pool members carry the active dates (AssetPools).

**Actions.** Save facility default or explicit store override. Store policy wins only for that store order; show source on operational screens. Re-reserving open demand is a separate preview/confirm action; the setting change alone does not displace stock.

**One reservation editor (Nov 1, 2026; review X16, R-COM-05).** StoreReservation is the one editor of a
store's reservation fields (`inventoryFacilityId`, `reservationOrderEnumId`, `reservationAutoEnumId`,
`requireInventory`). It saves through Mantle's `mantle.facility.WarehousePolicyServices.update#StoreReservation`,
built in P3: a field-scoped, audit-logged ProductStore change that takes STOCK_POLICY_MANAGE in the store's
organization and refuses a stale `expectedLastUpdatedStamp`. Commerce StoreDetail's General tab shows the same group read-only, with the facility
defaults beside it, and links here; it defines no second form. Readiness and both screens read the
effective source (store override or facility default) from the same service.

| PoolStores | list, editable rows | Associate stores with the pool | store, dates | store lookup | entity AssetPoolStore | EditAssetPool AddStoreForm and StoreListForm |

**Actions.** Save changes, validate no historic allocations are rewritten, then separately preview affected open reservations. Membership is not permission to read unrelated owner data.

**Actions.** Preview then apply; recognize an already consumed provider batch/row, continue past invalid independent rows with named errors, and reconcile local movements after the snapshot. Provider order/settlement feeds declare which feed owns stock issuance so two feeds cannot issue it twice. Admin owns protocol credentials and jobs; Warehouse owns quantity exceptions and review.

(FindAsset `UpdateProductCost` and `CreateEquipment`, AssetDetail `UpdateAssetAcquireCost`, and the
maintenance, meter, registration and custodian forms).

### 15.2 Services and source validation

The Forms tables name the screen-facing existing services or a proposed wrapper and its baseline.
Shared ShipmentDetail additionally preserves `update#ShipmentAndRouteSegment`, `create#ShipmentItem`,
`update#ShipmentItem`, `cancel#Shipment`, `send#ShipmentStoreEmail`, and the ShipmentInfoServices display/
shipping-option queries; source reservation actions use `reserve#AssetsForOrder`, `reserve#AssetForOrderItem`
and `reduce#AssetReservation`. Shared ReturnDetail uses the existing ReturnServices creation, returnable-item,
update and shipment methods under its action permissions. Authorization goes through Customer Service's
proposed `authorize#Return`, receipt through `receive#ReturnItems`, and settlement through
Accounting's `settle#Return`; `receive#ReturnWithoutShipment` is not exposed. Their exact per-mount
coverage is carried into usl-inventory, without marking internal helper calls as screen APIs.

**Existing financial triggers.** These Mantle SECAs and entity ECAs run on Warehouse's designed paths today. Each one is
kept, conditioned or replaced as below; the crosscut §1.3 register lists them all. A condition is a Mantle rule
change behind its own flag, off by default (impl-accounting §4).

| SECA or EECA | Runs when | Warehouse path | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ShipmentOutgoingPackedCreateInvoices` | An outgoing shipment becomes ShipPacked | Pack CompletePack | Kept, and conditioned behind D3's flag (impl-accounting §4): it creates the sales invoice (`create#SalesShipmentInvoices`) InvoiceInProcess with no payments applied, and a ShipShipped SECA finalizes it, applying captured payments. With the flag off it finalizes at pack as before. Reopen package first calls Accounting's `release#ShipmentDraftInvoice`. |
| `ShipmentIncomingDeliveredCreateInvoices` | An incoming shipment becomes ShipDelivered | Receive ReceiveRemaining; `close#ReceiptRemainder` | Conditioned behind D2's flag (crosscut §4.4; impl-accounting §4): runs only for a supplier marked self-billing, and bills accepted quantity only. Service-line and subcontract output receipts get no bill from it. |
| `ShipmentDeliveredReturnReceive` | A sales-return shipment becomes ShipDelivered | ReturnReceipt | Replaced by `receive#ReturnItems`, which records receipt without processing responses. |
| `ReturnReceivedProcess` | A return becomes ReturnReceived | ReturnReceipt | Replaced on this path: receipt never runs `process#ReturnItemResponses`; Accounting's `settle#Return` settles after inspection. |
| `ReturnApprovedProcess` | A return becomes ReturnApproved | NewReceipt for a return | Conditioned behind D11's flag (impl-accounting §4): it keeps only `create#ReturnShipment`, and NewReceipt opens that shipment. |
| `AssetStatusAvailableReservations` | An asset becomes AstAvailable | QualityInspection release | Kept; the `dispose#Inspection` reserves stock with customer demand provenance first. |
| `AssetStatusNotAvailableReservations` | An asset leaves AstAvailable | QualityInspection quarantine; a move into a held location | Kept. When a whole reserved asset becomes held, its reservations are removed and the order is re-reserved on other available stock, or left not available. A partial move into a held location makes a new held asset and carries the reservation beyond the source's ATP onto it, and the SECA does not run; the move guard then calls `check#AssetReservations` on the held asset (impl-warehouse F38). |
| `AssetLocationFromContainer`, `ContainerAssetLocation` (EECAs) | An asset's containerId is set; a container's location changes | ContainerDetail AddOrRemoveAsset and MoveContainer | Kept; `attach#AssetToContainer` refuses an asset away from its container, and `move#Container` moves the contents through the guard (impl-warehouse F9). |
| `OrderPlacedReserveAssets`, `OrderApprovedReserveAssets`, `OrderItemCreateCheckReserve`, `OrderItemUpdateCheckReserve` | An order is placed or approved, or an item changes | ShipmentDetail reservations; ReservationPolicies | Kept; reservations made at Placed stay while an order is held. Conditioned for a RecurringTemplate base order, which reserves nothing (Nov 1, 2026; review X5). |
| `AssetReceiptGlPost`, `AssetIssuanceGlPost` | A receipt or issuance is created | every receipt and issue | Kept; WH-POST passes acquireCost (transfers, kits, repack, returned material) so these post the right value. |
| `AssetIssuanceGlRePost` | An issuance is updated | MaterialIssueReceipt | Replaced (crosscut §1.3): Accounting AC-06 changes the repost to a dated reversal. Warehouse never triggers it, because BOSS never updates a posted production issuance. |
| `AssetDetailPhysicalVarianceGlPost` | A variance AssetDetail is created | CountReview PostCount; Adjustments; Scrap | Kept; `post#Count` follows its per-asset rule. Its `post#PhysicalInventoryVariance` picks the account by reason, then by sign (Adjustments Scrap). |
| `ShipmentShippedSendEmail`, `ShipmentDeliveredSentEmail`, `ShipmentPackageDeliveredCheckShipment` | A shipment ships or is delivered; a package is delivered | Ship; PackageTracking | Kept. |

Return shipments create no invoice, because their sources have no orderId. Count posting needs no
Accounting screen: `AssetDetailPhysicalVarianceGlPost` posts each approved variance, and Accounting reads
the result in its ledger.

Source checks on Oct 27 distinguish active services from comments/interfaces. `CarrierServices.get#ShipmentRates`
is commented out and is not a working service. The new shipment-rate adapter calls configured providers
implementing the active `get#ShippingRatesBulk`/`get#ShippingRate` interfaces; it does not call a bare interface
as a concrete provider. The existing order bulk-rate action is useful for order context but assumes store
configuration, so it is not a sufficient standalone Warehouse adapter. `record#PhysicalInventoryQuantity`
remains an immediate posting service. All new count methods are separately specified in WH-COUNT.
`receive#EntireShipment` accepts each ShipmentItemDetail row's quantity less what was accepted and rejected,
sets nothing short and then delivers the shipment. The view joins receipts and issuances on shipment and
product, so on a shipment that also has issuances (a transfer) it multiplies each total by the other's row count:
two issuances and two receipts read twice the accepted and issued quantities, and the service then delivers the
transfer short without receiving the rest (impl-warehouse F37, Mantle's WarehouseStockChecks spec). It also takes
the item's quantity, not what was issued. Finish never uses it for a short receipt (Receive), and a transfer's
"Receive all as expected" sums its issuances and receipts apart and receives through the receive guard (Transfers).

## 16. Documents and outputs

| Output | Kind | From screen | Derived from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Receipt and rejected-goods receipt | html-print/PDF; receipt confirmation email | ReceiptDetail, Receive | Shipment display/receipt data; ERPNext Purchase Receipt |
| Putaway and transfer sheet | html-print/PDF | Putaway, TransferShipmentDetail | ShipmentPick and source/destination move data |
| Picklist and combined pick/pack sheets | html-print/PDF | PicklistDetail | Shipping/Picklist/ShipmentLoadPick and ShipmentLoadPickAndPack; `ShipmentInfoServices.get#ShipmentLoadPickInfo` |
| Packing slip, package contents and inserts | html-print/PDF | Pack, ShipmentDetail | ShipmentPack, ShipmentByPackage, ShipmentInsert; `ShipmentInfoServices.get#ShipmentPickPackInfo` |
| Carrier labels, return labels and manifests | provider file/PDF; html-print manifest | Ship, ReturnReceipt (customer return label through `request#ReturnLabel`), DeliveryTripDetail | ShipmentServices.print#ShipmentLabels; carrier gateway label result; ERPNext Delivery Trip |
| Location, lot/serial, container and box labels | PDF (ZPL later) | FacilityDetail, Lots, Containers, BoxTypes | Facility/PrintBoxTypes; Carbon and Odoo label layouts; Products' barcodes; lot and location labels use the printer purposes of WH-LABEL |
| Stock at date export | CSV/XLSX | StockAtDate | Same `get#InventoryAtDate` rows and cut-off; incomplete history flagged |
| Blind count sheet and reviewed variance sheet | html-print/PDF | CountDetail, CountReview | Odoo stockinventory; Carbon count review; server omits blind quantities |
| Inspection evidence and disposition certificate | html-print/PDF | QualityInspection | Shared quality template items as of the inspection, and its readings |
| RMA receiving and supplier-return slip | html-print/PDF | ReturnDetail, ReturnReceipt | Return source items and Shipment display data; Odoo return slip |
| Quantity, movements, history and lineage export | CSV/XLSX | InventoryAvailability, Movements, OperationsHistory, Traceability | Same authorized query and filters as each screen; no hidden financial/blind-count fields |
| Count-entry import and result report | CSV with preview; row-result CSV | CountEntry, CountReview | Exact count-line identity and observation fields; WH-COUNT validation |
| External stock snapshot mapping/errors | CSV upload and result download | ExternalStockSync | ridgecrest inventory import; WH-SYNC operation identities |
| Exception notifications | existing shell notifications; configured email | Receive, Pick, CountReview, QualityInspection, Ship | Commons notification providers and existing shipment email templates |

Document generation/printing failure is reported separately from the already committed stock operation.
A print takes an effective date and time, and a reprint uses the original document as of that time. Print methods never act as a posting endpoint.

## 17. Framework and data needs

The following IDs are stable for the crosscut roll-up. Existing shell/widgets/records are inputs;
only the stated extensions are new. Every proposed data write is a service-authorized business action.

| Need | Kind | Proposed as | Used by | Stub spec |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WH-SHELL — Warehouse providers | shell item | Warehouse quick-create, palette, Today and notification providers using existing shell contracts | Home, HandheldHome and all record screens | Authorized facility/owner queries; record identity and task context; no new shell widget. |
| WH-POST — Guarded stock operations | service type | `mantle.shipment.WarehouseTaskServices` entry points around existing shipment/asset services, shared with crosscut stock-operation contract | Receive, Putaway, Move, Repack, Adjustments, Assets, ContainerDetail, Pick, Pack, Ship, PackageTracking, Transfers, returns | Operation key on Accounting's one CX-POSTING operation record (impl-accounting §4), checked and written in the posting's transaction: a retry with the same request answers the stored result, and a different request under the same key is refused. Exact source identity, version, quantities/UOM; atomic dependent stock/document writes and reversals; independent batch result collection; recheck permission, facility, source capacity, quality, expiry and posting period. When a stock fact's automatic GL post fails Accounting's guard (a missing mapping, say), the post goes to Accounting's error journal with the failed guard named, never a silent success (impl-accounting §4). Label purchase has a durable provider request and recovery state. Receipt entry points: `ensure#PurchaseReceipt`, `adjust#ExpectedReceipt`, `close#ReceiptRemainder`, `generate#TrackingIdentities`. Movement entry points: `move#Stock` (one asset or part of it; Move, HandheldMove), `relocate#Assets` (Relocate, a result per asset), `attach#AssetToContainer`, `detach#AssetFromContainer`, `move#Container`, `repack#Asset`, `scrap#Asset`; `repair#FacilityReservations` for ReservationCheck (built in P5 on `StockPosting.js`, impl-warehouse §4). Shipping entry point: `record#PackageDelivery`. Every named-asset issue or reserve checks Asset.statusId, so quarantined stock is neither issued nor reserved. Receipts, issuances and ShipmentItemSource rows carry the enteredQuantity, enteredQuantityUomId and appliedConversionFactor (CX-POSTING). Transfers copy the source issuance's acquireCost and owner into the destination receipt, and Setup readiness requires AssetTypeGlAccount.transferGlAccountId. Kit receipts carry acquireCost = issued component cost ÷ kit quantity. Repack runs inside an organization-owned WepAssembling WorkEffort and nets to zero. Posted receipts and corrections queue Accounting's `queue#MatchReevaluation` through an EECA on AssetReceipt. |
| WH-SCAN — Scan and tracking input | XML Form element | `scan-input`, a new form field element (style-guide §8.1), whose resolvers are the existing facility/asset/shipment services; optional camera adapter later | Handheld mounts and all task screens | Keyboard-wedge/manual input first. Its `resolver` names a service: in `scanText`, `allowedTypes`, the screen's context (facility, task) and a client `scanId`; out `matches` (`identityType`, `id`, `label`, `detail`) and `parsed` GS1 fields. One match fills the field and submits with the `scanId`, several open the ambiguity chooser, none names the failure and keeps focus; quantity confirmation stays explicit. The transition uses the `scanId` as its operation key on the CX-POSTING record, so a double scan answers the first (impl-warehouse §4). GS1 parsing is the framework's shared parse that Products builds, and barcode nomenclature configuration a shared framework service, not regexes in screens. HTML/tui fallback is a text input posting to the same resolver. A pack barcode resolves through Products' `resolve#ScannedProduct` (code → product, pack product, contained quantity and unit, ambiguity list), the one resolver that receiving, packing and repack call. |
| WH-COUNT — Count snapshots and review/post | data model | Extend active PhysicalInventory/PhysicalInventoryCount; `mantle.product.InventoryCountServices`; `mantle.facility.CountSchedule` | Counts, CountDetail, CountEntry, CountReview, CountVariance, StockPolicies | Header adds mode, scope, blind flag, assignees, started/reviewed timestamps and scope version. Line adds exact owner/pool/status/container/asset-or-serial identity where applicable, stock UOM, snapshot quantity/time/version, observed quantity/time, entry state, review reason/reviewer, approved delta and posting operation/result/AssetDetail links. Existing quantityOnHand carries the observation. Preserve PI status IDs; a count adds PICancelled (before anything posts) and its count mode marks it as a count (impl-warehouse F235). The count schedule is the effective-dated `mantle.facility.CountSchedule` of the warehouse policy, written through `WarehousePolicyServices.store#CountSchedule`, its key fields audit-logged (impl-warehouse §4); a row schedules locations or products, not both: scope by organization, facility, location type, area or location, product category or ABC class; kind periodic every N days, annual on a month and day, or zero confirmation when a location's stock reaches zero; count mode (full, cycle or spot), blind default and assignee. FacilityLocation.lastCountDate and ProductFacility.lastCountDate, written by `post#Count`. ABC classes are per product at a facility: the audit-logged ProductFacility.abcClassEnumId over a new `AbcClass` enumeration seeded A, B and C, extended as data, set by hand through `store#ProductFacilityPolicy`; an unclassed product is counted by the schedule's other scopes. Accuracy- and movement-based frequencies and computed ABC classes are later. |
| WH-COUNT services | service type | `create#Count`, `update#Count`, `start#Count`, `record#CountLine`, `submit#Count`, `review#Count`, `resolve#CountConflict`, `recount#Count`, `post#Count`, `find#DueCounts` in InventoryCountServices | Counts family | Start freezes scope; record only saves observation; server enforces blind read restrictions; review reconciles post-snapshot movements; post locks disjoint stock buckets, revalidates reviewed versions, records per-line outcomes and calls immediate variance services only for approved deltas. Import uses the same line validation and named partial errors. `post#Count` passes the count's physicalInventoryId and an open-period effective date, adds approved deltas up per exact asset (the variance SECA posts one transaction per asset per PhysicalInventory), values at the asset's acquireCost and shows that basis in the preview. Counts and CountVariance leave out scrap PhysicalInventory records (WH-SCRAP). `find#DueCounts` gives each location, or product at a facility, its next date: the last count plus the frequency, or the annual date, whichever is earlier; the short-pick recount and Request a count are ad hoc dues. |
| WH-PUTAWAY — Storage destinations and capacity | data model | `mantle.facility.PutawayRule` and storage-type applicability; `mantle.facility.PutawayServices` | Putaway, Move, PutawayRules, Capacity, ContainerDetail | Existing ProductFacilityLocation remains product default. Rule fields: ruleId, owner organization, facility, input location/type, product/category/storage type, target location/type, priority, from/thru, active and capacity constraints. `store#PutawayRule`, `resolve#Destination`, `get#Capacity` explain chosen/rejected destinations and use compatible units with incoming reservations; never repurpose Facility people capacity. |
| WH-QUALITY — Shared inspections | data model | Crosscut §3.19 `mantle.product.quality.InspectionTemplate`, InspectionTemplateItem, QualityInspection, InspectionReading and `mantle.product.QualityServices` | Inspection, Receive, Putaway, Ship, returns | Warehouse contributes source receipt/item, accepted/rejected/held quantities and disposition destinations; the template's effective-dated items as of the inspection's creation (InspectionTemplates) and immutable verification evidence; use shared `store#InspectionTemplate`, `create#Inspection`, `save#InspectionReading`, `submit#Inspection`, `verify#Inspection`, `dispose#Inspection`. NCR/CAPA/gauges are later extensions, not a duplicate Warehouse model. Held is a status: Receive posts inspected receipts as AstQuarantine into an FltQuarantine or receiving location and calls `create#Inspection` in the same operation. Keys: held quantity = open-inspection quantity; match-eligible = AssetReceipt.quantityAccepted minus held; dock rejection = AssetReceipt.quantityRejected with no stock. `get#SourceInspectionStatus` returns them to matching and planning. `dispose#Inspection` reserves stock with customer demand provenance before the AstAvailable auto-reserve runs. |
| WH-EXPIRY — Eligibility and expiry history | service type | The expiry gate inside Mantle, behind its WarehousePolicy flag, off by default (impl-warehouse §4); audited lot corrections | Lots, Receive, Pick, Ship, Move | Current FEFO/newer-inventory selection does not provide the whole posting gate, and Mantle's own SECAs reserve on order placement and approval, which BOSS guards never see. With the flag on, reservation skips assets whose own or lot expiry has passed and names a shortfall, and issue (sales and production) refuses an expired asset with its date; quarantine, return, disposal and moves are unchanged, and near-expiry warnings show the date. With it off Mantle behaves as today. Track corrections with old/new/reason/actor through `WarehouseTaskServices.correct#LotMetadata`. |
| WH-PICK — Load and short-pick workflow | service type | Extend ShipmentWorkServices plus WarehouseTaskServices `record#ShortPick`, `finish#Pick`, `reverse#Pick`, `find#PickFaceReplenishment` and `ShipmentWorkServices.preview#ShipmentLoadsForOrders`; `mantle.shipment.ShipmentPickException` | Picklists, PicklistDetail, CreatePicklists, Pick, PickLocationMoves | Retain WepShipmentShip, Shipment.shipWorkEffortId, binLocationNumber and ShipmentItemSource.quantityPicked/quantityNotHandled; quantityNotHandled is the quantity still to handle, not a shortfall. A short pick creates a ShipmentPickException (exceptionId, shipmentItemSourceId, assetId/locationSeqId, quantityShort and its UOM, reasonEnumId, resolutionEnumId, physicalInventoryId of a recount, operationKey, actor and time) and a recount, never an automatic stock decrement; line states derive from the quantities plus the open exceptions. `reverse#Pick` puts back picked stock of a reduced source line. `find#PickFaceReplenishment` reads ProductFacilityLocation minimumStock and moveQuantity. |
| WH-WAVE — Automatic batching | service type | Later wave-policy fields in operation policy and preview/scheduled generation over ShipmentWorkServices | CreatePicklists, StockPolicies | Group by facility/carrier/destination/date with limits, assignees and pick path. Preview exclusions and reserve before release; one independent load result per group. Manual load/bulk creation remains first release. |
| WH-TRACE — Traceability queries | service type | `mantle.product.TraceabilityServices.get#Traceability` | Traceability, AssetDetail, Lots, Movements | Bounded cycle-safe traversal of AssetReceipt/Issuance/Detail and production source/output links; paginated nodes/edges, quantity/UOM, event time, source URL, provenance gaps and permission-filtered fields. No new stock balance or ledger table. |
| WH-GRAPH — Lineage visualization | Vue component | Later TraceabilityGraph.qvue and terminal twin | TraceabilityGraph | Graph/selection details over WH-TRACE; terminal renders tree/table and the same node actions; accessible keyboard selection. |
| WH-LABEL — Rating, labels and printing | tool | The shipment-rate adapter `mantle.shipment.WarehouseTaskServices.get#ShipmentRates` and durable provider-operation results; shared PDF label generation/dispatch (ZPL later); Mantle test carrier | Ship, Pack, PackageTracking, Carriers, BoxTypes, Printers, Lots, Containers | `WarehouseTaskServices.get#ShipmentRates` assembles shipment/package data and dispatches configured active rate interfaces; `CarrierServices.get#ShipmentRates` remains commented. A local-rules provider adapts the `get#OrderShippingRateLocal` logic for methods with no gateway. Reuse existing label request/track/refund/print APIs. Printer capability and delivery result are distinct from stock success; provider failures permit safe reprint/status lookup. Extend FacilityPrinter with copies, fromDate and thruDate; seed the purposes PtpLotLabel, PtpLocationLabel and PtpCountDocuments. Labels are PDF only in the first release, through Products' barcodes; ZPL, with FacilityPrinter's labelFormatEnumId and label-printer capability, is later (impl-warehouse §4). `mantle.shipment.carrier.TestGatewayServices`, a seeded ShippingGatewayConfig, implements every carrier interface deterministically for specs and demos, with reserved ship-to postal codes for a timeout, a refused label and an invalid address, and its own record of the labels it issued (Carriers). `mantle.facility.PrintServices.dispatch#Document` and `get#PrinterCapabilities` sit over the framework print services and the NetworkPrinter record. `WarehouseTaskServices.request#ReturnLabel` (returnId) adds the package and route segment to the existing return shipment and requests the return label with an operation identity. |
| WH-POLICY — Effective operational policy | data model | `mantle.facility.WarehousePolicy` and `mantle.facility.WarehousePolicyServices` | StockPolicies, ReservationPolicies, AssetPools, FacilityDetail | Organization/facility defaults plus explicit ProductStore reservation overrides; effective-dated rows with audit-logged key fields (impl-drawers-commons §4), where a change ends one row and starts the next, applies at posting and rewrites no history; resolver explanation. The CountSchedule rows (WH-COUNT) and the expiry gate's flag (WH-EXPIRY) are WarehousePolicy's. `store#OperationPolicy`, `store#TrackingPolicy`, `store#ReservationPolicy`, `resolve#WarehousePolicy`; existing Facility flags and ProductFacility policy remain authoritative for their fields. Add shipping-dock location enum; map autoStatusId consistently. TrackingPolicy has organization, facility and product scope and holds the serial/lot pattern. Receipt and delivery steps 1–3 choose default locations and visible queues only. All ProductFacility and ProductFacilityLocation writes go through `mantle.facility.FacilityServices.store#ProductFacilityPolicy`, a Warehouse-owned contract that Purchasing, Products and the shared screens call (CX-FACILITY-POLICY). Nov 1, 2026 (X16): the store reservation fields are saved only through the built `mantle.facility.WarehousePolicyServices.update#StoreReservation` (P3), which ReservationPolicies' StoreReservation calls; Commerce shows them read-only. |
| WH-REQUEST — Internal stock context | service type | Extend existing RequestDetail and RequestServices stock-request actions | StockRequests, RequestDetail | RqtInventory item destination/UOM/required date and supplied quantities; approve/cancel with audit; link Requirement and fulfillment documents via current request joins/RequestRecord. Never clone the request just to show it in Purchasing. `RequestServices.get#InventoryRequestProgress` (requested, approved, allocated, transferred and received quantity with Requirement and RequirementSupply links) and `WarehouseTaskServices.allocate#InventoryRequest` (a ShpTpTransfer through `create#Shipment`, or a guarded `move#Asset` within one facility). `complete#RequestFromWork` does nothing for RqtInventory. |
| WH-PLAN — Common supply planning | service type | Crosscut §3.20 PlanningRun, PlanningSuggestion, RequirementSupply and `mantle.product.SupplyPlanningServices` | SupplyPlanning, StockRequests | Transfer context of the same `run#SupplyPlan`, `get#SupplyPlan`, `convert#PlanningSuggestions`; provenance and idempotent conversion. Freshness/as-of and unavailable projection are visible, with transactional revalidation at conversion. One current PlanningRun per organization and facility set, started from any planner mount or by the shared `store#PlanSchedule` job. Warehouse converts transfer suggestions with the stock planner capability; quantities are in the stock unit. Held quantity shows as a pending-release line, left out of netting by default (§18). |
| WH-RETURN — Return eligibility and disposition | service type | Crosscut §3.18 guards over existing ReturnServices and ShipmentServices | Returns, ReturnDetail, ReturnReceipt, SupplierReturnShipment | Preserve source order/return/shipment/serial links, lock cumulative eligibility, separate authorized/physical/financial progress; disposition through shared quality. No parallel RMA table. `WarehouseTaskServices.receive#ReturnItems` (built by Accounting to this contract; impl-accounting §4) replaces the `ShipmentDeliveredReturnReceive` and `ReturnReceivedProcess` SECAs on the receipt path: it sets ReturnItem.receivedQuantity for accepted and rejected units, never changes returnQuantity and never processes responses. `WarehouseTaskServices.ship#SupplierReturn` sets ReturnShipped when the ShpTpPurchaseReturn ships. Supplier-return keys: returnId/returnItemSeqId, assetReceiptId, assetId; the quarantined asset is issued through `issue#AnyAssetForShipmentItemSource`. Purchasing's `find#ReturnableReceipts`, with PUR-RETURN's ReturnItem link to the AssetReceipt and asset, gives eligibility: accepted plus quarantined quantity less earlier supplier returns, locked per receipt and lot. Settlement is Accounting's `settle#Return` only. |
| WH-TRIP — Delivery stops | data model | Later `mantle.shipment.carrier.DeliveryStop` linked to existing Delivery and ShipmentRouteSegment; proposed DeliveryServices | DeliveryTrips, DeliveryTripDetail | Stop ID/sequence, shipment/route, address, planned/actual arrival, result, recipient/evidence, return-to-depot link; create/update/complete trip methods. Delivery has no status or driver today: add proposed Delivery.statusId with the proposed statuses DlvPlanned → DlvReleased → DlvInTransit → DlvCompleted or DlvCancelled, and a proposed Delivery.driverPartyId. Stops complete independently, each source shipment atomically. |
| WH-REPORT — Operational aggregates | service type | Authorized operational queries over current entities; later pivot/graph list view dependency | Reports, StockAtDate, Movements, CountVariance, OperationsHistory | Same filters and organization/owner permissions as detail; explicit date basis and compatible-UOM totals; no materialized truth tables. Reuse existing views; proposed framework pivot/graph support follows style-guide §8 if needed. `mantle.product.InventoryReportServices.get#InventoryAtDate` reads the AssetDetail ledger by effective date with facility, location, lot and owner scope and an incomplete-history flag; Customer Service's StockAtDate mount uses it too. Later: an Age column and an age-bucket saved find over Asset.receivedDate (quantity only). |
| WH-SYNC — External stock snapshots | data model | Later `mantle.product.asset.ExternalStockBatch`/ExternalStockRow and ExternalStockServices | ExternalStockSync | Provider/batch/row idempotency, source as-of, mapping, owner/facility/UOM, raw quantity, reviewed delta, conflict/error, operation/result link; import/map/review/apply methods. Admin owns credentials/protocol jobs, Warehouse owns review; independent failures continue and issued-stock ownership is explicit per feed. |
| WH-HANDHELD — Handheld density | XML Screen element | `density="handheld"` screen attribute (style-guide §8.2), shared with Manufacturing | HandheldHome and every Warehouse/Handheld mount | Set on Warehouse/Handheld: 48 px controls, 18 px text, no drawer, header reduced to title and account. The attribute wins over the user's comfortable or compact density preference, which applies everywhere else (impl-warehouse §4). The html and tui renders keep the same fields and order. |
| WH-RECORD-HOSTS — Files and Chatter hosts | data model | `mantle.product.asset.AssetContent` and `mantle.order.return.ReturnContent`, registered in `get#RecordLinkInfo` (crosscut CX-RECORD-HOSTS) | AssetDetail, EquipmentDetail, ReturnDetail, Returns | Each host has a single-field key and its own content entity. Shipment, Facility, Request, Order and WorkEffort hosts already have one. Warehouse records with no Files tab: PhysicalInventory (counts), PutawayRule, WarehousePolicy, ShipmentPickException, DeliveryStop and the ExternalStockSync batch. |
| WH-SCRAP — Scrap and disposal | data model | `WarehouseTaskServices.scrap#Asset`; `PhysicalInventory.scrapIndicator`; seed reasons InVrScrap and InVrExpired | Adjustments, AssetDetail, Lots, Move | Optional move to an FltMorgue location, then `record#PhysicalInventoryChange` with a scrap reason on a PhysicalInventory marked scrap, so Counts lists leave it out. Scrap posts by its reason (impl-warehouse §4): the organization's `VarianceReasonGlAccount` row for the reason, then for a scrap reason Accounting's AssetTypeGlAccount.scrapGlAccountId (AC-07), else found or shrinkage by sign; Accounting builds the poster change and seeds the scrap reasons' rows, and with nothing mapped it posts as Mantle does. Scrap inside a production run is Manufacturing's `record#ProductionLoss`. |
| WH-SUBCONTRACT — Vendor custody | seed data | FacilityParty role Custodian for the supplier at an organization-owned vendor-custody facility; Manufacturing's `ProductionServices.receive#SubcontractOutput` run from Warehouse | Transfers, SubcontractShipmentDetail, MaterialIssueReceipt | Facility.ownerPartyId is the organization, so `receive#Asset` never makes the supplier the owner. Dispatch is `move#Asset` with no in-transit step, or a ShpTpTransfer with cost and owner carried through WH-POST. The output receipt carries the run's workEffortId, no transfer shipmentId and no service PO line, and calls Purchasing's `accept#ServiceItem`. |

For new records without baseline fields (PutawayRule, WarehousePolicy, CountSchedule, DeliveryStop, ExternalStockBatch/Row, ShipmentPickException),
the stub's field list plus identifiers, organization scope and create/update audit metadata is the complete
minimum field set for the forms in this design. Implementation derives normal validation from each field's
record/UOM/source relationships; it must not infer additional business authority from a caller parameter.

## 18. Decided

| Decision | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Queue-first landing and complete candidate coverage | Research Home → Home; Receiving → Receipts/ReceiptDetail/Receive/Putaway/Supplier360; Inspection → Inspections/shared inspection/templates; Inventory → Availability/Product360/Assets/AssetDetail/Movements/Adjustments/Lots/Containers/Traceability; Counts → Counts/CountDetail/CountEntry/CountReview; Transfers/requests → Transfers/TransferShipmentDetail/Move/StockRequests/RequestDetail/SupplyPlanning; Picking → Picklists/PicklistDetail/CreatePicklists/Pick/PickLocationMoves; Packing/shipping → Shipments/Pack/Ship/PackageTracking/OrderDetail; Returns → Returns/ReturnDetail/ReturnReceipt/SupplierReturnShipment; Locations → Facilities/FacilityDetail/EquipmentDetail/PutawayRules/Carriers/BoxTypes/Printers; Handheld → explicit contextual task mounts; Reports and Settings → §14. Every candidate is present or consolidated into these named screens. |
| Reuse one stock and document model | Asset/AssetDetail are balance and history; Shipment represents receipt, dispatch and transfer; ReturnHeader/ReturnItem represent RMA; WorkEffort WepShipmentShip is the picklist/wave. No replacement warehouse/bin/stock-balance/return tables. |
| Full inspection record, shared with Manufacturing/Purchasing | Research inspection-scope question resolved by WH-QUALITY: templates, samples/readings, inspector/verifier, outcome and disposition. Rejected quantity alone is insufficient evidence. Warehouse managers with quality authority edit the shared templates locally. |
| Further quality functions are later | NCR/CAPA, quality document control and gauge calibration extend shared quality; no separate Warehouse quality module. Their work/result links remain visible from QualityInspection. Full operator measurement overlays follow the shared Manufacturing context. |
| Count-post is a separate service | Research count question resolved: entry stores observations, review resolves movement conflicts, post calls existing variance logic. No deferred-mode change to record#PhysicalInventoryQuantity. Blank is uncounted, zero is explicit, and blind quantities are withheld server-side. |
| Reservation defaults work without a store | Research setting-ownership question resolved: Warehouse/Commerce edit the same permitted ProductStore reservation fields; Warehouse also supplies facility defaults. An explicit store override wins for its orders and its source is visible. Existing facility negative-issue/owner rules still apply. |
| Internal requests are the existing shared RequestDetail | Research request question resolved: RqtInventory context with items/destination and approval; one Requirement links buy/make/transfer supply. Purchasing may fulfill a buy requirement without creating a duplicate request. |
| External fulfillment sync has two responsibilities | Research 3PL question resolved: Warehouse's later ExternalStockSync owns mapping/conflicts/results; Admin owns provider credentials/jobs. Both access the same integration/batch state. No direct unreviewed absolute overwrite of local stock. |
| Short picks are exceptions, not automatic corrections | A short pick creates a ShipmentPickException; quantityNotHandled remains the unhandled remainder, as Mantle defines it. Recount or an authorized independent adjustment resolves stock truth. Partial/backorder decisions preserve outstanding order demand. (R-WH-02) |
| Task screens have explicit handheld mounts | Receive/Putaway/Pick/Pack/Move/Count and the pick-face moves are the same records, services and operation IDs with handheld presentation. Online-first; keyboard wedge/manual input baseline; camera optional. No offline posting queue is implied. |
| Shipping and receiving gates share stock eligibility | Tracking totals, expiry, quality hold, source quantity, UOM, permissions and period rules are enforced at posting. Existing FEFO/newer-lot lookup is retained, not mistaken for a complete gate. |
| Physical completion and financial completion remain distinct | Warehouse receives/ships/disposes; Accounting values/posts/credits/refunds. Standalone mounts expose only actions the user is authorized to perform, with no requirement for an unrelated launcher grant. The existing SECAs that join the two are named in §15.2 with their decision (D1). |
| Existing invoice SECAs on Warehouse paths | The sales invoice at pack (`ShipmentOutgoingPackedCreateInvoices`) is kept, and CompletePack says so. Behind D3's flag it stays InvoiceInProcess until a ShipShipped SECA finalizes it (impl-accounting §4), so between pack and ship Reopen package and put-back call Accounting's `release#ShipmentDraftInvoice` first, with `refund#OrderPayment` when the order shrinks; after ship, changes go through returns and credit memos (D3, R-WH-01b, R-WH-26). Behind D2's flag the receipt bill (`ShipmentIncomingDeliveredCreateInvoices`) runs only for self-billing suppliers, for accepted quantity (crosscut §4.4; R-WH-01c, R-SB-01). |
| Returns are received, not settled, by Warehouse | `receive#ReturnItems` replaces `ShipmentDeliveredReturnReceive` and `ReturnReceivedProcess` on the receipt path; settlement is Accounting's `settle#Return` after inspection and disposition, never at receipt. Customer Service's `authorize#Return` settles nothing at approval, and behind D11's flag `ReturnApprovedProcess` only creates the return shipment, which NewReceipt opens. `receive#ReturnWithoutShipment` is not exposed. Supplier returns ship through the `ship#SupplierReturn` (D11; R-WH-01a, R-WH-01d, R-SB-02 to R-SB-05). |
| Customer Service order changes reach Pick and Pack | Customer Service applies a substitution on a short pick and a cancelled balance through the proposed `apply#OrderChange`; Pick executes the substitution, and Pick or Pack puts back stock of a reduced line (D9; R-WH-26). Other change kinds are not Warehouse actions. |
| Material issues and returns are new facts | Production issues never merge into an earlier issuance, and unused material returns through `return#UnusedMaterial` as a new receipt, never `cancel#AssetIssuance`. Movements carry the run's workEffortId and the run line ID (D13; R-SA-02, R-SA-07). |
| Subcontract material stays company stock | Warehouse dispatches and takes back components at SubcontractShipmentDetail from an organization-owned vendor-custody facility; Manufacturing owns the requirement and the `receive#SubcontractOutput`, Purchasing the service PO and the `accept#ServiceItem`, Accounting the charge (D14; R-WH-08, R-SA-08, R-SA-13). |
| Kits are pick assemblies; Warehouse costs them | Kit components come from Products' Kit components (PtPickAssembly only); the kit receipt carries the issued component cost, so no WIP remains (D15; R-SA-04). |
| Packs and units | Product-specific packs are pack products with PatPackagingFor (Products states the direction); dimensional units use the global UomConversion. Receive converts a pack to its base product through `resolve#ScannedProduct` or stocks the pack; Repack converts stocked packs, value-neutral through a WepAssembling WorkEffort. Transactions keep the entered quantity, unit and factor (D16; R-WH-07, R-SA-06, R-SA-14). |
| Product facility policy has one writer | Warehouse owns the `store#ProductFacilityPolicy` contract (StockPolicies); Purchasing ReorderRules, Products and the shared screens call it. The planning schedule is the shared `store#PlanSchedule`, and Warehouse converts transfer suggestions (D20; R-XC-09, R-XC-20, R-XC-39). |
| Quality hold is a status | Receive posts inspected receipts as AstQuarantine and creates the inspection; `get#SourceInspectionStatus` feeds matching and planning, and held quantity is excluded from bill matching. Planning shows it as a pending-release line (Held quantity in planning, below) (D21; R-WH-03, R-SA-10). |
| Capability groups | §1 maps each Warehouse capability to one `BOSS_WAREHOUSE_*` group; financial-read is Accounting's group (D22; R-WH-17). |
| Stock at date is a Warehouse report | StockAtDate over `get#InventoryAtDate` (built P17), owner-aware; Customer Service mounts it (D24; R-WH-06). |
| Files hosts | Asset and return Files use AssetContent and ReturnContent; the Warehouse records listed in WH-RECORD-HOSTS have no Files tab (D25). |
| Handheld count name | The handheld count mount is HandheldCount, like its siblings; its path stays Warehouse/Handheld/Count (D27; R-WH-31). |
| One definition for ad hoc receipt, box and printer assignment | Receive AdHocReceipt is the one ad hoc receipt form; MaterialIssueReceipt and crosscut §3.9 link to it (R-XC-21). Facility box-type and printer assignment live only in FacilityDetail; BoxTypes keeps box and carrier codes, and Printers is a cross-facility index (R-WH-16). |
| Production staging is a move in the first release | Manufacturing's Components "Stage" opens Move with the run fixed; a production pick mode is later (§19 Open). |
| Handed-off baseline forms | FindAsset `UpdateProductCost` → Accounting valuation (`AssetBookServices.post#Revaluation`). AssetDetail `UpdateAssetAcquireCost` → Accounting EquipmentBook (crosscut §3.10). FindAsset `CreateEquipment` → Maintenance, with crosscut §3.10 EquipmentDetail to gain a NewEquipment dialog. Maintenance, meter, registration and custodian forms → Maintenance (R-WH-23). |
| Moves, landed cost, cross-dock and trends | Moves are immediate guarded tasks; there is no planned stock-transfer document. Landed-cost allocation is Accounting's (Payables LandedCosts on receipt lines); Warehouse reads it. Cross-dock is declined with route engines. Home cards carry counts only; later trends use Insights' existing panel engine and registered Warehouse measures with facility/owner scope, units, source dates and inventory reconciliation (R-WH-24). No second stock ledger or unguarded generic sum. |
| Drop shipments | ShpTpDrop shipments are left out of Warehouse queues and shown read-only in Shipments under a type filter; Purchasing and Sales own them. Drop-ship invoicing is Accounting's `create#InvoiceFromSource`, called by Purchasing's proposed `confirm#DropShipDelivery` (R-WH-29, R-SB-20). |
| Transfers carry value | A ShpTpTransfer issue needs AssetTypeGlAccount.transferGlAccountId, and WH-POST copies acquireCost and owner into the destination receipt (R-SA-08). |
| Advanced features stay designed as later | TraceabilityGraph, Capacity workbench, automatic wave rules, DeliveryTrips/DeliveryTripDetail, ExternalStockSync and pivot/graph reporting follow first-release operational parity. First release still has ledger/tree traceability, destination capacity enforcement, manual waves and shared core quality. |
| Reference-only extras are bounded | 3PL storage-fee subscriptions/customer stock portal, arbitrary push/pull route engines and carrier route optimization are not separate first-release Warehouse screens; owner stock is already visible by owner, fee/portal work remains Commerce/Accounting, multi-step receipts/deliveries are explicit policy-driven queues (the 1–3 step table in StockPolicies), and later trips accept manually ordered stops. |
| Posted data is corrected, not erased | Existing baseline direct status/quantity editing is replaced by named guarded actions. Label refunds, document reprints and tracking refresh never imply stock reversal. Independent batch failures name the item and continue; dependent movements remain atomic. |
| Research and inventory staleness is explicit | Current capability notes above correct the expiry and commented shipment-rate claims. A stale inventory row does not make a service callable; proposed API work is clearly labeled. |
| Shared-screen rows (D28; R-WH-15, R-WH-25) | Settled in crosscut §3 on Oct 28, 2026: §3.7 InventoryAvailability has the Movements tab, the later Age column and bulk Relocate; §3.5 Product360 has the Replenishment tab; §3.8 ShipmentDetail has the Transit pane, `close#ReceiptRemainder` and a Warehouse row per mount; §3.10 has a Warehouse EquipmentDetail row; and §3.11 RequestDetail has the InventoryRequestProgress panel over `get#InventoryRequestProgress` and `allocate#InventoryRequest` (WH-REQUEST). |
| Root, groups and facility scope | `BOSS_WAREHOUSE` is the root user group and artifact group. Its groups take `MANTLE_USER_ORG` and `MANTLE_PRIVATE_CONTACT`, whose Facility filter (`ownerPartyId` in `filterOrgIds`) is the facility scope; `BOSS_WAREHOUSE_ADMIN` has all authz on the root with `MANTLE_ACTIVE_ORG` and works in every facility. Stock rows go through `AccessServices` (§1). Third-party-owned facilities that hold the organization's stock are later (impl-warehouse §4). |
| Changes by effective date and the audit log | WarehousePolicy and CountSchedule are effective-dated rows with audit-logged key fields; inspection templates change by effective-dated items (InspectionTemplates); the supplier at a vendor-custody facility keeps the Custodian FacilityParty role; Mantle's audit-logged Asset, Shipment, Lot and ReturnItem fields are kept (impl-warehouse §4, impl-drawers-commons §4). |
| Scan input | `scan-input` is a new form field element. Its `resolver` service takes `scanText`, `allowedTypes`, the screen's context and a client `scanId`, and answers `matches` and `parsed` GS1 fields; one match submits with the `scanId` as the transition's operation key, several open the chooser, none names the failure and keeps focus. html and tui fall back to a text input on the same resolver (WH-SCAN; impl-warehouse §4). |
| Handheld density | On a `density="handheld"` screen the attribute wins over the user's comfortable or compact preference, which applies everywhere else; each task has its own handheld mount, so desk users take the desktop screen. Manufacturing's screens follow (WH-HANDHELD; impl-warehouse §4). |
| Expiry gate inside Mantle | Behind its WarehousePolicy flag, off by default: reservation skips assets whose own or lot expiry has passed and names a shortfall, and sales and production issue refuse an expired asset with its date; quarantine, return, disposal and moves are unchanged. It is in Mantle because Mantle's own SECAs reserve on order placement and approval, which BOSS guards never see (WH-EXPIRY; impl-warehouse §4). |
| Scrap posts by reason | `post#PhysicalInventoryVariance` reads the organization's `VarianceReasonGlAccount` row for the reason, then for a scrap reason the asset type's `scrapGlAccountId`, and otherwise found or shrinkage by sign, so damage, theft and expiry can post apart. With nothing mapped it posts as Mantle does and needs no flag; Accounting builds the change and seeds the scrap reasons' rows (WH-SCRAP; impl-warehouse §4). |
| Cycle-count schedule | Settles the former §19 item: CountSchedule rows of WarehousePolicy by organization, facility, location type, area or location, product category or ABC class, each periodic every N days, annual on a date, or zero confirmation. Last count dates are on FacilityLocation and ProductFacility; the next date is the earlier of the periodic and annual dates; the short-pick recount and Request a count are ad hoc dues. Accuracy- and movement-based frequencies are later (Counts, WH-COUNT; impl-warehouse §4). |
| ABC classes | Per product at a facility: an audit-logged ProductFacility.abcClassEnumId over a new `AbcClass` enumeration seeded A, B and C, extended as data and set by hand; an unclassed product is counted by the schedule's other scopes. Computed classes are later (WH-COUNT; impl-warehouse §4). |
| Barcode devices and labels | Settles the former §19 item without its ZPL option: keyboard-wedge and manual scanning first, camera scanning later, on the same resolver and confirmation; labels are PDF only in the first release, and ZPL, with FacilityPrinter's format field and label-printer capability, is later (WH-SCAN, WH-LABEL; impl-warehouse §4). |
| Test carrier | Mantle's `mantle.shipment.carrier.TestGatewayServices`, a seeded ShippingGatewayConfig implementing every carrier interface deterministically, with reserved ship-to postal codes for a timeout, a refused label and an invalid address, for specs and demos; real carriers are later gateways (Carriers, WH-LABEL; impl-warehouse §4). |
| A run keeps its own lines | Under the shared rule a run's revision, release time and frozen standard cost are audit-logged fields of the run, in place of the designed snapshot records. Its material and output lines are ProductionRunLine records with stable IDs, written at create from the BOM and routing as of a date and frozen at release, because issuances and receipts reference them; its operation children carry their routing operation, sequence and work center. BOMs are dated lines released by date (impl-products §4), so a later release leaves a released run's lines as they were (MaterialIssueReceipt; impl-warehouse §4). |
| Mantle rule changes and the operation record | Each Mantle rule change sits behind its own flag, off by default, so plain Mantle and its specs keep their behavior: D2's receipt billing, D3's pack invoice and D11's return settlement on PartyAcctgPreference, and the expiry gate on WarehousePolicy. Every guarded posting keys Accounting's one CX-POSTING operation record by `operationKey`, and a guard failure on a stock fact's automatic GL post goes to Accounting's error journal with the guard named (§15.2, WH-POST; impl-accounting §4). |
| Held quantity in planning | Settles the former §19 item as recommended: held quantity with an open inspection is a pending-release supply line with its inspection due date, left out of netting by default; the plan schedule's organization option nets held quantity whose inspection is due within the lead time (SupplyPlanning, WH-PLAN; impl-manufacturing §4). |
| Contracts Warehouse builds for other apps | Crosscut CX-QUALITY with its two shared screens; Manufacturing's runs and their lines, and its production stock guards with the CX-PRODUCTION fields; Purchasing's `accept#ServiceItem`, `close#PurchaseRemainders` and `find#ReturnableReceipts` with its receipt link. Each keeps its owner's names, packages, Shared screens and capability groups, and the owners' own screens stay theirs (impl-warehouse §4). |
| One store reservation editor (Nov 1, 2026; review X16, R-COM-05) | ReservationPolicies' StoreReservation is the one editor of a store's reservation fields, over Mantle's built `WarehousePolicyServices.update#StoreReservation` (P3); Commerce StoreDetail shows them read-only and links here. |
| Recurring templates are not demand (Nov 1, 2026; review X5, R-SC-01) | A RecurringTemplate base order is left out of the order and pick queues, Home counts, availability checks and reservation; only its renewals are fulfilled. |
| Report services and printers (Nov 1, 2026; review R-INS-06, Z4) | Reports cite the built `InventoryReportServices` (`run#StockTransactions`, `get#InventoryProjectedInfo`, Accounting's `run#InventoryValuation`); printers are Admin Connections' `NetworkPrinter` records, which Warehouse only binds to facilities. |

## 19. Open

The existing financial SECAs are decided (§15.2, §18), and so are barcode devices and labels, held quantity in
planning and the cycle-count schedule (§18, impl-warehouse §4). The items below stay open as later work
(impl-warehouse §7), and several need a crosscut decision; those are marked "(also in crosscut §9)". Review the
deployment choices against the first adopter; defaults below are the design until changed explicitly:

- **Automatic wave policy thresholds.** Recommend manual reviewed groups in the first release and no
  scheduled automatic release. Later limits/grouping are tenant policy, previewed by CreatePicklists.
- **Owner-stock services beyond inventory (also in crosscut §9).** Recommend a separate later
  Commerce/Accounting design for customer stock portals and storage-fee billing; preserve owner identity and
  movement provenance now. Storage-fee billing needs dated owner snapshots, so `get#InventoryAtDate` is
  owner-aware from the first release (StockAtDate).
- **Production picking (also in crosscut §9).** Recommend later: Picking gains a production pick mode over
  a released run's material lines (ProductionRunLine). It moves stock to an FltStaging location for the run, and
  MaterialIssueReceipt issues from staging. Production reservation needs a
  proposed `AssetReservation.workEffortId` plus the material line ID (CX-PRODUCTION). The first release
  stages through Move.

Acceptance review covers purchase receipt → partial inspection → putaway; short receipt closed or
backordered before delivery; reservation → shortage → recount; pick/pack → multiple packages → label
timeout/retry → ship; reopen a package after pack; customer and supplier returns with partial
physical/financial completion, including a return in two boxes; subcontract dispatch and output receipt;
repack; transfer in transit; blind count with concurrent receipt/issue and failed independent lines; lot
expiry change; invalid serial/UOM; mixed owners/pools; unauthorized financial fields; closed-period correction; and standalone Warehouse operation without a ProductStore or other app grant.
All Markdown/source checks are documentation checks; this pass does not build application screens or run
runtime tests.
