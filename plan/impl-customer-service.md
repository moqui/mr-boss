# IronStone BOSS — Customer Service implementation

Nov 5, 2026 — P0 done (F45–F73), build started. Nov 1, 2026 — plan; P0 partly done (F1–F44, found while writing it); the phase order and the open questions decided
(§4), on the shared party-role and effective-date rules and the Mantle boundary (impl-drawers-commons §4); the
customer pages as a PASS app in mr-pass (§4); consistency pass: brought in line with the Accounting and Warehouse
builds and the Nov 1 decisions

How [design-customer-service.md](design-customer-service.md) gets built, in phases from the foundation to the Support
app, each ending tested and usable. This file is kept at a high level, as [impl-products.md](impl-products.md),
[impl-accounting.md](impl-accounting.md), [impl-warehouse.md](impl-warehouse.md),
[impl-manufacturing.md](impl-manufacturing.md) and [impl-purchasing.md](impl-purchasing.md) are: each phase names its
scope by the design's sections and §12 needs rather than restating them, and the design stays the place for screen and
record detail. During the build this file is the log: phase status and what each built, the decisions made, open
questions, findings against the code, and what is deferred.

Today `screen/CustomerService/` holds eight flat placeholders, and the root mounts only Chatter and RecordFiles. The
`BOSS_CUSTOMER_SERVICE` admin authz is live (F1); P1 adds the root user group and the ordinary groups. None of the
design's proposed services, entities, fields or status items exist in Mantle or BOSS beyond what the five apps built
before it provide. Customer Service is the last of the six core apps, built after Manufacturing and then Purchasing
(§4), so these are there to extend, and P0 checks that each landed:
- from Products: Product360 with its substitutes (PatEquivalent, PatReplacement) and `check#ProductUsable` on both
  order-entry paths (P2); `store#ProductPrice`, the resolver with its trace and `Shared/PriceExplain` (P5);
  `Shared/InventoryAvailability` (P7);
- from Accounting: the AR, treasury, approve and read groups (P1); the CX-POSTING operation record (P2);
  `Shared/Customer360`, InvoiceDetail's receivables context and `send#Invoice` (P4); `Shared/ShipmentDetail` and the
  Approvals mount (P6); CX-ORDER-HOLD's `hold#Order` and `release#OrderHold`, and `CreditServices` with
  `evaluate#OrderCredit`, `get#CustomerCreditStatus` and Customer360's Credit tab (P10); `receive#ReturnItems`, the
  conditioned return SECAs, `preview#ReturnSettlement` and `settle#Return`, `release#ShipmentDraftInvoice`,
  `refund#OrderPayment` and `Shared/ReturnDetail` (P17); CX-PORTALS' `ExternalAccessServices`, the invoice's pay link,
  and the PASS Billing and Supplier apps, the first beyond Forum, which settle how a PASS app registers (P18);
- from Warehouse: the receive, inspect and quality-manager groups (P1); CX-QUALITY with `Shared/QualityInspection` and
  the disposition vocabulary (P8); `record#ShortPick` with ShipmentPickException, and the cancelled balance's
  `ShipmentItemSource.putBackQuantity` (P11);
  ReopenPackage (P12); WH-LABEL and its test gateway (P13); ReturnReceipt, `request#ReturnLabel` and ReturnContent (P14);
  `Shared/StockAtDate` with `get#InventoryAtDate` (P17);
- from Manufacturing: the maintenance request and AssetMaintenance on EquipmentDetail (P11), beside which a warranty
  repair sits;
- from Purchasing: the approval decision pattern with its stale-revision refusal (P3, P4); supplier returns (P8), which
  a customer case links to; CX-REQUEST's type check in `complete#RequestFromWork` and RequestDetail's Items tab in
  every context (P10); agreement statuses (P13);
- from Projects: `Shared/RequestDetail`, `Shared/WorkItemDetail`, `Shared/OrderDetail`, `Shared/InvoiceDetail`,
  `complete#RequestFromWork`, and the intake settings and tokens;
- from Commons: notification topics with approve and refuse services, Notifications, Chatter, RecordFiles, Compose with
  its text-block picker, Knowledge with WikiPageReview, the working hours of Preferences, and the palette, quick-create,
  Today and record-link providers;
- from PASS (mr-pass), where the customer pages go as a new app (§4): its public shell, sites with their host and app
  mounts, public accounts and invitations, the `pass.Facade` operations with Mantle's PassApi routes for a remote
  frontend, media staging and scanning, and the forum's case services.

## 1. Scope and order

- **Repositories.** Each is its own git repo:
  - `mr-moqui` (`crates/`, `runtime/base-component`)
  - `runtime/component/mr-mantle`
  - `runtime/component/mr-boss`, the internal app
  - `runtime/component/mr-pass`, the customer pages as its Support app (§4)

  `runtime/component/mr-marble` is read only, for the baseline Request, Return, Customer, Order and Survey screens that
  design §10 maps. Framework work is limited to what P0 finds CS-FORM-ELEMENTS needs (P5, P7), DbForm's dated, audit-logged
  fields (P7), and a record viewers topic if P0 finds it cheap (P5).
- **Scope.**
  - Every `parity` and `new` row of design §2, and the §12 needs they use, except ChannelAutomation.
  - The design reshaped by the shared rules (§2, §4): queues, service-level policies, status mappings, assignment
    rules, templates, return policies and defaults are effective-dated rows with their key fields audit-logged, not
    versions; a case, episode, return or invitation keeps the row it was evaluated against, and the time; a case's
    organization and people are RequestParty roles; order changes and warranty claims are their Requests, and case
    templates DbForms (§4).
  - The parts of other apps' needs that Customer Service still depends on (§4):
    - CX-REQUEST: the case rules of D23 on every Request entry point, and the support-case rule in
      `complete#RequestFromWork` beside Purchasing's type check;
    - Commons: a team's working hours, the business-time service, and the survey builder (crosscut §8);
    - crosscut §3.2: Customer360's CustomerServiceStatistics, ServiceAgreements and DeliveredItems forms;
    - Mantle's forum services: a queue route for `create#CaseFromTopic` (F12).
  - Shared screens: the survey builder's four screens (crosscut §2) and `Shared/OrderChangeDetail`, which Sales also
    mounts, with the Customer Service context only. Customer Service's
    context on the fourteen shared screens other apps built:
    - Products' Product360 and InventoryAvailability;
    - Projects' RequestDetail, WorkItemDetail, OrderDetail and InvoiceDetail;
    - Accounting's Customer360, ShipmentDetail and ReturnDetail;
    - Warehouse's QualityInspection and StockAtDate;
    - Commons' contact record (ContactDetail), Knowledge, and Notifications as Approvals (crosscut §3.15).
  - The customer pages of design §8 as a new PASS app, Support, in mr-pass (§4): its own app mount beside Forum, the
    Mantle services it calls through PASS's facade, and their routes for a remote frontend. It replaces design §8's
    `screen/ServicePortal.xml` root and its `BOSS_SERVICE_PORTAL` group for Customer Service's pages (F42).
  - The callers the other plans leave to Customer Service (their §7): `authorize#Return`, `apply#OrderChange` (the
    cancelled balance and the substitute on a short pick), Issue return label, and its CX-APPROVAL topics on
    Purchasing P4's decision pattern.
  - §7 holds the `later` rows and needs, and the rest of the other apps' needs.
- **Order** (decided Oct 28, 2026), the case spine first, then the order-side work on what the other apps built:
  1. the foundation;
  2. cases and queues, with the case rules on every entry point;
  3. customers and orders, the records a case links;
  4. service levels;
  5. assignment and saved replies;
  6. channels;
  7. case templates;
  8. merge, split and closing;
  9. returns;
  10. order changes;
  11. warranty;
  12. knowledge;
  13. feedback;
  14. reports;
  15. the Support app in mr-pass;
  16. the finish.

## 2. Ground rules

- **The Commons rules hold.** These are impl-drawers-commons §4:
  - failure tolerance;
  - the Mantle-free framework;
  - Mantle stands without BOSS;
  - business logic leans to Mantle;
  - the new XML element checklist of style-guide §8.1;
  - libraries through `libs/refresh.mjs`, and crates against `deny.toml`;
  - the `.qvue` gallery pattern;
  - parties by role;
  - changes by effective date and the audit log;
  - demo data;
  - builds and commits.

  The walks are on Products' pattern (impl-products §2): one golden-path walk in `test/client/`, the rest acceptance
  tests.
- **Service rows through services.** Under the organization filters (impl-drawers-commons §4), Party, OrderPart, Shipment, ReturnHeader and Invoice
  are filtered, but not Request, RequestCategory, OrderHeader, OrderItem, CommunicationEvent or the Request joins (F2).
  Customer Service reads and writes them only through services: `ironstone.customerservice.AccessServices` checks the
  organization, the customer, the queue and team, the record and the capability, then the screen calls the Mantle
  service, which checks its own permission (P1) and the organization by party relationship
  (`get#PartyOrganizationInfo`). No same-named `ironstone` pass-through is built.
  - `entity` in a design form summary means that guarded path, never a bare entity form.
  - Grants are checked in the services, so they hold for exports, search, the palette, notifications and shared
    mounts. The `BOSS_CUSTOMER_SERVICE_*` groups get no artifact authorization for the raw Mantle request, return and
    order mutators or their REST paths.
- **Public pages in mr-pass, internal ones in mr-boss** (§4). The customer pages are the PASS Support app, on PASS's
  foundation (design-forum §1, §4, §5):
  - PASS's public shell and its host and app-mount routing, with Support as an app beside Forum; server-rendered HTML
    with qvue enhancement, working at 390 px. PASS has no terminal UI yet, so design §8's terminal equivalents wait
    for it (§7).
  - Public accounts hold only `ALL_USERS`; PASS roles live in its membership records. A customer contact reaches a
    customer's records through Mantle's checks of the contact's customer relationship and of
    `ExternalAccessCapability`, never through a UserGroup, so `BOSS_SERVICE_PORTAL` is not used here.
  - The app reaches the authority only through `pass.Facade.call#Operation`: each operation is in PASS's
    `Schema.js`, its route in `Routes.js`, and Mantle's PassApi servlet serves it to a remote frontend. The same pages
    work with a local Mantle or a remote authority with only framework, webroot and PASS installed. BOSS is not a PASS
    runtime dependency, so no `ironstone.*` service, BOSS screen or BOSS group is called.
  - PASS's request contract: allow-listed projections with capabilities and revisions, opaque cursors, operation IDs
    on creates, `expectedRevision` on changes, and its HTTP result kinds (design-forum §4.3).
  - A bearer link (an RMA, a feedback invitation, a queue's public form) is a page of the app that takes its token, as
    PASS's Unsubscribe does, checked by Mantle's `check#AccessToken`, not a BOSS `<token-route>`.
  - Uploads go through PASS's media staging and scanning, finalized into the record's content.
- **What Mantle runs is Mantle's** (F41; impl-drawers-commons §4, §4 here). The Request rules, the jobs, the Support
  app and the BOSS screens call the same Mantle services, in the package of the records they change:
  - `mantle.request.SupportCaseServices`: the case core (`ensure#CaseProfile`, `assign#Case`, the case's create,
    update, transition, call log, merge and split, saved-reply apply, the template checks, closing), the saves of
    queues, teams, types, status mappings, workflows, defaults, assignment rules, routes and templates, and the
    customer services;
  - `mantle.order.OrderChangeServices`, `mantle.request.KnowledgeServices` and `mantle.request.CaseFeedbackServices`,
    beside the design's ReturnPolicyServices, SlaServices and WarrantyServices.

  Their records are `mantle.request.support` and `mantle.order.return` entities, never BOSS `entity/`, and the topics
  they send on are seeded in mr-mantle with Mantle handlers, BOSS setting the links (F44). Mantle specs grant the
  permissions to spec-local groups, never a `BOSS_*` group. `ironstone.customerservice` keeps AccessServices, the
  screens' reads, settings forms and reports, and calls the Mantle services.
- **Audience on the server.** Every message, file, link, status label, count and print is customer-visible or internal
  by a server rule, never by a hidden field. A customer contact, a customer-visible print and a customer notice get
  outward messages, approved shared files and customer labels only; no internal note, internal file, staff detail,
  other customer, cost or supplier value. A service leaves out of its answer any cost, supplier price, credit fact or
  financial amount the user may not read (in Mantle by `ACCOUNTING_VIEW`, `PRODUCT_COST_VIEW`, `SUPPLIER_PRICE_VIEW`
  and `CUSTOMER_CREDIT_VIEW`); it is omitted or said to be withheld, never shown as zero (design §1).
- **Service records follow the shared rules** (impl-drawers-commons §4; §4 here):
  - Parties by role: a case's organization is a RequestParty in the OrgInternal role, as Purchasing's request is
    (impl-purchasing §4); its customer, contact and assignee are RequestParty rows in the Customer, Reporter and
    Assignee roles; a team member is a dated PartyRelationship from the agent to the team; a return's assignee is a dated
    ReturnParty row (F24). The fields Mantle keys by stay: Request's filer, ReturnHeader's customer and vendor. A queue's
    organization is an owner field on RequestCategory (F6), as Products P3 gave feature groups one.
  - Policies and settings are effective-dated rows with their key fields audit-logged: the queue settings, ServicePolicy,
    ServiceLevelPolicy and its targets, CaseStatusMapping, ServiceAssignmentRule, team participation, ReturnPolicy,
    ServiceKnowledgeSource and the feedback delivery policy. A draft is a row with no from date; Publish sets it and ends
    the row it replaces. A case, episode, return or invitation keeps the row it was evaluated against, and the time.
  - The audit log on the key fields a phase locks: Request's type, category, priority, due date and resolution (status
    is logged already), ReturnHeader's new fields, and the order-change and warranty fields of P10 and P11.
  - Records of their own stay where a fact has its own identity, and the phase says why: the SLA episode and its events
    (measurements, like postings), a case relation (merge, split, follow-up), the order-change and warranty decisions
    (as PurchaseApprovalDecision), the return authorization decision, article feedback, the feedback invitation, and the
    assignment cursor.
  - Prints take an effective date and time. A key revision stores its PDF on its record: the RMA authorization as
    ReturnContent, an applied order change and the order confirmation as OrderContent, a resolved case's summary as
    RequestContent when sent.
- **One case clock** (D23). A case's status changes, messages and linked work, from any screen or service, reach the
  SLA through Mantle's Request rules, not through Customer Service's screens alone. Every path that changes a case's
  status, due date or resolution outside Customer Service (F8) either records through the rule or refuses with the reason
  and a link to CaseDetail. `Request.responseRequiredDate` on a case is written by SlaServices only.
- **Revisions and operations.** Every authorization, application, decision, settlement call, bulk action, saved-reply
  apply, send and Support app submission names its source revision and an operation identity. A retry answers the first
  result, and a stale revision is refused naming the current one. The operation record is Accounting P2's
  CX-POSTING record (impl-accounting §4). A batch names each failure and goes on: cases, replies, returns,
  invitations, feedback reviews. One merge, split, authorization or application with its links commits atomically.
- **Shared screens.** Customer Service builds only the survey builder's four screens and `Shared/OrderChangeDetail`
  (§4). It adds its context to the
  shared screens of §1, each taking `appRoot` and server-derived capabilities on `Shared/RequestDetail`'s pattern, and
  its context adds no right a borrowed capability does not give: W and F act from Customer Service's mounts without the
  Warehouse or Accounting root, and A sees what they do read only (design §1).
- **Owner contracts.** A contract built here for another app follows that app's design: its package, its record and
  service names, its permissions, its Shared screen and its capability groups. A change found while building it is
  written into the owner's design. The owner's own screens stay with the owner.
- **Mantle rule changes keep Mantle's default.** Each new rule or refusal in Mantle acts only on a case (a request in a
  service queue), a queue route or a feedback invitation, which exist only where Customer Service is configured, and
  ships with a test of its condition and of its unchanged default (crosscut §7.1). The return and pack-invoice rules
  are Accounting's, behind their flags (impl-accounting §4); Customer Service's own are ServicePolicy flags. A
  permission check goes on a new Mantle service only; an existing one gains a refusal only behind its flag.
- **Mantle callers stay compatible.** Existing callers of these keep working:
  - `create#Request` from Comms, Chat, Commons QuickRequest, Projects NewRequest, `create#RequestFromEmail`,
    `create#IntakeRequest` and the forum's `create#CaseFromTopic`;
  - `complete#RequestFromWork` for Projects' types, and a project's intake token and mail rule;
  - `find#EmailTextBlocks` and Comms TextBlocks;
  - `create#ReturnFromOrder`, `request#Return`, `approve#Return` and `cancel#OrderItem`;
  - the framework FormResponse services for responses with no invitation;
  - PASS's Forum, Account, Members and Sites apps, its site and mount configuration, and its operation catalogue.

  Mantle's WorkProjectRequests, RecordVisibility, RecordLinks, WorkProjectClients, CommonsToday, OrderToCashBasicFlow,
  ReturnToResponseBasicFlow, ShipmentReturnMisc and WorkPlanToCashBasicFlow specs, PASS's specs (Forum, ForumAccess,
  PublicIdentity, Integrations, RemoteFixtures, and ForumHttp and RemoteHttp in the browser) and mr-marble's render
  specs pass unchanged, and so does the earlier apps' BOSS regression suite.
- **Done for a phase** means all of these:
  - impl-projects §2 "Done":
    - cargo tests for the touched crates, with goldens reviewed;
    - the regression tests for the rules the phase adds passing: Mantle's in mr-mantle, BOSS's in mr-boss;
    - the regression suites of mr-mantle and mr-boss passing within their budget;
    - `moqui lint --screens` clean for BOSS with the Debug binary;
    - the inventories' **Implemented in** columns;
  - an access rule the phase adds checked in `CustomerServiceAccess` (one holder and one non-holder on one verb, and
    another organization's record refused), not every service and mount; ProjectsAccess passing with the new
    package (F17);
  - for a phase that touches the Support app (P13, P15): the same for mr-pass, and lint clean for PASS;
  - its row and **Built** note here.

  No route fixtures: a screen sweep is an acceptance test, one per app per mode (F20). The phase's "usable when" and
  its §8 scenario are acceptance tests to write (`acceptance/CustomerService/`, `acceptance/client/CustomerService/`;
  for the Support app, the remote pair on RemoteFixtures' pattern and a browser walk on ForumHttp's and RemoteHttp's in
  mr-pass `acceptance/`), named in the phase; running them is not part of Done.

### P0 — Checks

Verify the design's riskiest assumptions against the code before building. Each result is a row in §6 and, where it
changes the design, an edit there. F1–F44 were found on Oct 28 while writing this plan. The design edits that §4's
decisions call for (the case's organization and people as RequestParty roles, the effective-dated policies, which
requests are cases, the queue intake in place of ProjIntake's triaged types, the forum service names, the order-change,
warranty and template models, the Mantle case core, and design §14's answers, with crosscut's customer accounts)
were made in the Oct 28 design sweep. The Support app's are made when P0 closes: design §2 and §8 point to a new
`mr-pass/plan/design-support.md` holding §8's pages on PASS's shell, identity and request contract, and design-forum
§1 and §13 gain the app. Still to check:

- **The other apps' state.** Answered Nov 1 for Accounting and Warehouse, which built their Customer Service parts:
  `get#CustomerCreditStatus` (F36), `ExternalAccessServices` (F17), the borrowed groups (F19), ReturnContent in
  RecordFiles (F24), the Change hold reason (OhtChange), the cancelled balance (`ShipmentItemSource.putBackQuantity`),
  `mantle.shipment.WarehouseTaskServices.request#ReturnLabel` (F37), `Shared/OrderDetail`'s Accounting and Warehouse
  branches (F35) and the PASS Billing and Supplier apps (F42). Still to check, since Manufacturing and then Purchasing
  are built before Customer Service, that each piece this plan relies on landed as its plan says: Purchasing P3 and
  P4's approval decision pattern with its stale-revision refusal, P8's supplier returns, P10's RequestItem unit, its
  type check in `complete#RequestFromWork` and RequestDetail's Items tab, and P13's agreement statuses; Manufacturing
  P11's maintenance request and AssetMaintenance; the RequestDetail contexts that Purchasing P10, Warehouse P15 and
  Manufacturing P11 add (F7); which of Products P2, P5 and P7 are built; and whether InvoiceDetail still needs a
  project link (F35).
- **PASS for a new app** (F43), as Accounting P18 settled it for Billing and Supplier, and what Support adds. How an
  app beyond Forum, Account, Members and Sites registers: its `PublicSiteApp`
  mount and target, navigation, readiness and operator configuration; the facade's operation and route catalogues and
  Mantle's PassApi route table; PASS invitations with organization grants, for a customer contact; media staging
  finalized into a record's content; the site pages' wiki binding, for published help articles; and the URLs Mantle
  builds for notices to a site's members.
- **Accounting's §5 answers.** The rule flags (its §4); the CX-POSTING record; the pack invoice, decided: behind D3's flag it is
  finalized at ship, so an order change between pack and ship releases it (impl-accounting §4, F26). The Approvals filter is decided: the topic list (impl-accounting §4, F14).
- **Which requests are cases** (F5, §4). Each entry point's type, category, parties and status at create, against the
  service-queue rule, and what Commons Today and the request lists show for a case.
- **The paths around a case** (F8). For each path that changes a request's status, due date or resolution, whether the
  Request status rule records it or the path must refuse a case.
- **Business time** (F13). Projects' business-day helpers (`set#TaskDates`, `get#WeekDays`), `get#NextBusinessDay`
  and Manufacturing P3's work-center calendar, for one Mantle business-time service.
- **Client content** (F18). Whether a client's file list of a visible request includes RqCntInternal content, and what
  Chatter shows a client of a request with no project.
- **Form engine** (F16, §4). Whether the dynamic form renders a DbForm in xml, html, the terminal and PASS's pages at
  390 px, for P7's templates and P13's feedback forms, and how a dependency row shows or requires a field there;
  whether an editable `form-list` with dependent options and a terminal row twin covers the condition rows of
  AssignmentRules and CaseTemplates, or CS-FORM-ELEMENTS needs a framework element under style-guide §8.1.
- **Approval handlers.** What Commons passes to a topic's approve and refuse services, against a decision bound to the
  return's or proposal's revision, as Purchasing P0 checks.
- **Reservations on a partial cancel** (F28). Run `cancel#OrderItem` with a partial quantity and read the reservations
  left, before P10 relies on `reduce#AssetReservation`.
- **Warranty repair.** Manufacturing P11's `EquipmentServices.create#AssetMaintenance` against the design's
  `WepMaintenance` work effort, for one repair record on a sold serial's Asset (F33).
- **Who is viewing** (§4). Whether the Dev AIDE presence (`set#Presence`, DevPresence) generalizes to a record topic
  at small cost; if it does, P5 builds the viewers and the warning before Send, and if not they stay in §7.
- **Demo data** (F34). What the earlier apps' demo data leaves: delivered sales orders with invoices and payments,
  returns, serialized sales, customers with contacts; and what P1 must make through services.

### P1 — Foundation

- **CX-ACCESS** (design §1, crosscut §1.4).
  - The groups of design §1: `BOSS_CUSTOMER_SERVICE_AGENT`, `_MANAGER`, `_ORDER_DESK`, `_RETURN_AUTHORIZER`,
    `_KNOWLEDGE` and `_ADMIN`, composed as Products' are, with `BOSS_CUSTOMER_SERVICE` as the root user group beside the
    artifact group of that name (§4, F3). W and F are the owners' groups (crosscut §1.4). C, the customer contact, is
    a PASS public account with no group (§2).
  - The root's admin authz is live (`ADMIN` and `BOSS_CUSTOMER_SERVICE_ADMIN`, with `MANTLE_ACTIVE_ORG` and
    `MANTLE_PRIVATE_CONTACT`; F1). P1 adds the root user group and the ordinary groups' authz with the organization
    filters of impl-drawers-commons §4 (`MANTLE_USER_ORG` and `MANTLE_PRIVATE_CONTACT`), and the service checks of §2.
  - `ironstone.customerservice.AccessServices`: the user's service organizations, their capabilities, own and borrowed,
    the queues and teams they work, and the customers they may serve: a Customer-role party whose owner passes the
    active or available organization filter, as Purchasing's supplier scope. Every later Customer Service service and
    shared mount calls it. A supplied organization, customer, case, order, return or invitation is checked against it.
    An agent sees the cases of their teams' queues and those assigned to them; a manager the teams they manage.
  - No artifact authorization for the raw Mantle request, return and order mutators or their REST paths. The client
    deny pattern's service pattern gains `ironstone.customerservice`, and ProjectsAccess its new verbs (F17).
  - The permissions Customer Service's Mantle services check (§2, §4): mr-mantle seeds its eleven new `UserPermission`
    rows beside `ORDER_APPROVE` in `MantleSetupData.xml` (`RETURN_AUTHORIZE` is Purchasing's, `CUSTOMER_CREDIT_VIEW`
    Accounting's), and BossSetupData grants them with `UserGroupPermission` rows:
    - `_AGENT`: `SUPPORT_CASE_EDIT`, `ORDER_CHANGE_REQUEST` and `CUSTOMER_CREDIT_VIEW`;
    - `_MANAGER`: `SUPPORT_CASE_EDIT`, `SUPPORT_CASE_MANAGE`, `RETURN_EXCEPTION_APPROVE`, `ORDER_CHANGE_APPROVE`,
      `WARRANTY_APPROVE` and `SUPPORT_CONTACT_INVITE` (the `support` app kind's permission, P13);
    - `_ORDER_DESK`: `ORDER_CHANGE_APPLY` and X4's `ORDER_CHANGE_HOLD_RELEASE`; `_RETURN_AUTHORIZER`:
      `RETURN_AUTHORIZE`; `_KNOWLEDGE`: `SUPPORT_KNOWLEDGE_EDIT`;
    - `_ADMIN`: all of these, with `SUPPORT_POLICY_EDIT` and `RETURN_POLICY_EDIT`.

    X4's seed change, if it has not landed: `ORDER_CHANGE_HOLD_RELEASE` seeded, and OhtChange's `enumCode` moved to it
    from `ORDER_APPROVE` (`OrderHoldEntities.xml`; crosscut CX-ORDER-AUTHORITY).

    W and F hold their owners' grants (`STOCK_RECEIVE`, `QUALITY_*`, `RECEIVABLE_EDIT`, `PAYMENT_EDIT`,
    `RETURN_CREDIT_APPROVE`).
- **The Customer Service root.**
  - The menu of design §1: Cases, Orders, Returns and Availability as menu groups holding their lists, Customers,
    Knowledge and Settings from the placeholders, and Approvals and Reports added (F1). Each area shows for its groups
    only.
  - `<shell-providers>` (CS-PROVIDERS): the palette types, quick create, Today sources and notification topics grow
    phase by phase, as their records are built.
  - The `customerservice` key scope.
  - `ironstone.commons.PaletteServices.get#RecordLink` opens cases, customers, orders, returns and warranty claims
    under Customer Service for its users; Projects and Commons keep their requests (F9).
- **Home** (design §3): ServiceMetrics over `ironstone.customerservice.ReportingServices.get#ServiceDashboard`, each
  measure of a later phase "Not configured"; the other panels arrive with their phases; panels by role.
- **Customer Service demo data.**
  - `BossCustomerServiceDemoData.xml` with ORG_ZIZI_RETAIL as the service organization and POPC_DEFAULT's products. It
    builds on Mantle's CustJqp, JoeDist and ORG_ACME customers, and through a demo service (Mantle has no seeded sales
    orders, F34) places, ships, invoices and pays orders for them: a delivered order with a serialized item, an order
    awaiting pick, and a packed order. Queues, teams, cases, returns and contacts are added as the phases need them.
  - `BossUsersDemoData.xml` gains a user per group, an agent who also holds Warehouse's receive and inspect groups, a
    return authorizer who also holds `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_AR`, and a service reader with no other launcher. P15 adds
    customer contacts.
- **Specs.**
  - `CustomerServiceShell`: the menu per group, the palette, record links, quick create.
  - `CustomerServiceAccess`: the app's one access spec, about seven features run once with authorization on:
    organization, customer and queue scope and the groups through the services, each group's permissions, and the
    refused REST paths. A later phase adds a case only for an access rule it adds.
- **Usable when** (an acceptance test to write): the menu renders for each group, and quick create offers only what the
  group may create. An agent finds their organization's customers and orders through the palette but not another
  organization's, and a forged customer or order ID is refused. A Projects client contact is refused the root and every
  `ironstone.customerservice` service.

**Built Nov 5 (P1).**
- Mantle: `MantleSetupData.xml` seeds `SUPPORT_CASE_EDIT`, `SUPPORT_CASE_MANAGE`, `SUPPORT_POLICY_EDIT`,
  `SUPPORT_KNOWLEDGE_EDIT`, `SUPPORT_CONTACT_INVITE`, `ORDER_CHANGE_REQUEST`, `ORDER_CHANGE_APPROVE`, `ORDER_CHANGE_APPLY`,
  `ORDER_CHANGE_HOLD_RELEASE`, `RETURN_EXCEPTION_APPROVE`, `RETURN_POLICY_EDIT` and `WARRANTY_APPROVE` beside
  `ORDER_APPROVE`, each with its ADMIN grant (none existed; `RETURN_AUTHORIZE` and `CUSTOMER_CREDIT_VIEW` did).
  X4: `OrderHoldEntities.xml`'s OhtChange takes `ORDER_CHANGE_HOLD_RELEASE`; `test/order/PurchaseHoldPermission` checks
  the Change hold's new permission and that `ORDER_APPROVE` no longer places or releases it, and `PurchaseRevisions`' gate
  feature releases with the new permission (the only caller that released a Change hold under `ORDER_APPROVE`).
- BOSS access (`data/BossSetupData.xml`): the groups `BOSS_CUSTOMER_SERVICE` (root user group), `_AGENT`, `_MANAGER`,
  `_ORDER_DESK`, `_RETURN_AUTHORIZER` and `_KNOWLEDGE`; the root authz `BOSS_CUSTOMER_SERVICE_ROOT` (`MANTLE_USER_ORG`,
  `MANTLE_PRIVATE_CONTACT`) and the `ironstone\.customerservice\..*` service pattern on the `BOSS_CUSTOMER_SERVICE`
  artifact group; `customerservice` in the client deny pattern (its fourth row split in two, F75); the area groups
  `BOSS_CS_RETURNS` and `BOSS_CS_REPORTS` (agent, manager, return authorizer, admin), `BOSS_CS_APPROVALS` (manager,
  return authorizer, admin) and `BOSS_CS_SETTINGS` (admin), each denying the root user group; the record link group
  `BOSS_CS_RECORD_LINK`; the `UserGroupPermission` grants of the list above. No authz for the raw Mantle request, return
  and order mutators or their REST paths.
- `ironstone.customerservice.AccessServices` (`get#SharedContext`, `check#Record`, `get#Choices`, `search#Records`) over
  `CustomerService.js`, whose tables later phases extend: `capabilityPermissions` (own, and the borrowed `receive`,
  `inspect`, `dispose`, `invoiceCredit`, `paymentRefund`, `returnCredit`), `areas` (returns, approvals, reports,
  settings), `recordKinds` (order, customer; a `destination` once a screen is built), `searchFinds` (sales orders,
  customers), `choiceSources` (customers, organizations) and `linkPaths`; the scope's `queueIds` and `teamIds` are empty
  until P2. A customer is a Customer-role party, not internal, not another user's private contact, owned by one of the
  user's organizations or shared (`_NA_`); a sales order's selling organizations must be the user's and its customers ones
  they serve. `ReportingServices.get#ServiceDashboard` (every measure not configured, the period, and the panels by role).
- The root (`screen/CustomerService.xml`): the menu of design §1 (Home, Cases, Customers, Orders, Returns, Approvals,
  Availability, Knowledge, Reports, Settings; Approvals and Reports added, the placeholders renamed and re-indexed, each
  comment naming its phase and groups), `<shell-providers>` with the palette source and the `customerservice` keymap;
  Home (`CustomerService/Home.xml`: the KPI strip, each "Not configured", with its period and time, and the record
  lookup); `PaletteServices.get#RecordLink` opens a sales order under Customer Service (Home's lookup until P3 sets
  OrderDetail) and a customer once Customer360 is built (F77).
- Demo: `BossCustomerServiceDemoData.xml` (the warranted, serialized thermostat `BOSS_CS_THERMOSTAT` with its
  `BOSS_CS_WARRANTY_12` PftWarranty feature and serials CS-THERMO-1001/1002, the stocked filter `BOSS_CS_FILTER`, both
  Retail's at ZIRET_WH; Ziziwork Services' customer `BOSS_CS_CUST_OTHER` and open order `BOSS_CS_SO_OTHER`) and
  `BossZCustomerServiceDemoData.xml`, which runs `ironstone.customerservice.DemoServices.load#CustomerServiceDemo`
  (`Demo.js`, each order in its own transaction, F76): `BOSS_CS_SO_DELIVERED` to CustJqp (paid by check, shipped,
  invoiced at ship and delivered; the thermostat's Asset is the customer's, AstDelivered, with its AssetIssuance),
  `BOSS_CS_SO_PICK` to JoeDist (approved and reserved, awaiting pick) and `BOSS_CS_SO_PACKED` to JoeDist (packed).
  BossUsersDemoData's `customerservice.*` users: agent, manager, orderdesk, returns, knowledge, admin (in
  `BOSS_CUSTOMER_SERVICE_ADMIN` alone), agentwh (with `BOSS_WAREHOUSE_RECEIVE` and `_INSPECT`, no Warehouse launcher),
  returnsar (with `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_AR`), read (the root user group alone) and services (Ziziwork Services' agent).
- Specs: `test/CustomerService/CustomerServiceSpecLib.js` (ids, users, `shell`, `page`, `routeFixtures`) and
  `CustomerServiceAccess` (8 features, about 3 s: the context and its refusals, a Projects client's among them; the menu,
  providers and launcher per group; Home's one qvt render; the capabilities per group; customer scope in choices and the
  palette; the record check with another organization's and forged ids and a capability on a record; record links; the
  guarded areas, REST and raw mutators refused). No separate Shell spec (impl-purchasing F44). Acceptance:
  `acceptance/CustomerService/CustomerServiceFoundationWalk` (the usable-when: every area per group, the palette and
  record links of the agent and the other organization, forged ids on check#Record and Home's lookup, a Projects client
  refused the root and every `ironstone.customerservice` service; the demo orders' state), and `AppStructure` renders
  Customer Service's built screens (CustomerServiceSpecLib.routeFixtures; the placeholder count is now 54, the floor stays
  53). ProjectsAccess walks the new package with the deny pattern.
- Inventories: no ss-inventory or usl-inventory row is implemented by P1 (Home's request lists are P2's).
- Tests run: CustomerServiceAccess (8), ProjectsAccess, PurchasingAccess, PurchasingRevisions, PurchasingOrders,
  WarehouseAccess, WarehousePicking, WarehousePacking, WarehouseShipping, WarehouseReports, WarehouseInventory,
  AccountingReceivables, AccountingAccess, AppOrganizationFilters, Contacts, Inbox, CommsHome, ProductsAccess,
  ManufacturingAccess (BOSS, all pass); PurchaseHoldPermission, PurchaseRevisions, PurchaseOrders, OrderToCashBasicFlow,
  ReturnToResponseBasicFlow, ShipmentReturnMisc, AccountingCredit, SupplierPortal, WorkProjectRequests, RecordLinks
  (Mantle, all pass); acceptance CustomerServiceFoundationWalk (5) and AppStructure (18), all pass. `moqui lint
  --screens`: no idiom or hazard site in the Customer Service screens.
- Decisions:
  - The areas by group: Home, Cases, Customers, Orders, Availability and Knowledge for every Customer Service user (the
    service reader reads them, each list and record limited by AccessServices); Returns and Reports for the agent,
    manager and return authorizer; Approvals for the manager and return authorizer; Settings for the administrator. A
    later phase opens a settings page to the manager, authorizer or author with its own authz row. The order desk and the
    knowledge author see the reader's menu until their phases (P10, P12) add their areas.
  - Cases, Orders, Returns and Availability stay single placeholder screens until their phases make them menu groups
    holding their lists (P2, P3, P9).
  - The demo uses its own products (as Accounting's `BOSS_ACCT_SUPPLY`), so its orders change no other product's
    availability; POPC_DEFAULT is the orders' store.
  - No quick create, Today source or notification topic in P1: the phases that build their records add them.
- Findings (provisional):
  - **F74** `mantle.party.Party.ownerPartyId` defaults to `_NA_`, so Mantle's ORG_ACME and ORG_BLUTH, which the data
    gives no owner, are shared parties (P0's F73 reads them as unowned): ORG_ACME is a shared customer in every
    organization's Customer Service scope, as ZiddlemanInc is a shared supplier in Purchasing's. The demo leaves it so;
    CustomerServiceAccess checks that both organizations serve it.
  - **F75** Adding `customerservice` to the client deny pattern took its fourth row (post … reply) past the 255
    characters of `artifactName`; it is split into two rows. The next app package will need the same check.
  - **F76** A data file loads in one transaction, so a demo service that makes each record in a transaction of its own
    (for failure tolerance) cannot see the rows of its own file: the products and stock are in
    `BossCustomerServiceDemoData.xml` and the service call in `BossZCustomerServiceDemoData.xml`, loaded after.
  - **F77** A customer's record link stays the Commons contact until P3 builds Customer360 under Customer Service
    (`hasScreen('customer')`), as Purchasing left requests to their other apps until its screens were built; a sales order,
    which had no link (impl-purchasing F46), opens Customer Service's Home lookup now.
  - **F78** Crosscut X4's table also names `BOSS_PURCHASING_BUYER` (a PO revision) and `BOSS_SALES_CHANGE` for
    `ORDER_CHANGE_HOLD_RELEASE`. P1 grants neither: a purchase revision's Change hold is released by its approval or
    cancel (`PurchaseRevisions.releaseRevisionHold`), not by `release#OrderHold`, and no Purchasing group held
    `ORDER_APPROVE`, so nothing it did is refused; Sales has no group yet. For the lead to decide with X4.

**Review Nov 5 (P1).** Checked the Mantle and BOSS diffs against this section, §2, design §1, AGENTS.md and
Practices-App-Dev:
- Record links: a sales order went to Purchasing's branch before (`orderKind` answers `order` for any order, and its
  `readOrder` refuses one whose customer is not internal), so it had no link for anyone; now a Customer Service user in
  scope gets Home's lookup and every other user (Accounting, Warehouse, Commons, Purchasing) still gets none. A purchase
  order fails `isSalesOrder` and stays Purchasing's; a party keeps Commons until `hasScreen('customer')`.
- Shared customers: a `_NA_` customer passes `customerOf` for every organization, as the Party filter passes it, but a
  sales order is checked by its selling organizations (`readOrder`'s owners, every one the user's) as well as its
  customers, so another organization's order of a shared customer is refused; the palette's order find is limited to the
  user's vendors in the query.
- Demo data: the orders use their own products, so DEMO_* stock, availability and projections are unchanged. Ran besides
  the worker's list (all pass): Mantle SalesReports, ProductStockTotals, ReportLookups, MantleSearch, CrmMiscServices,
  OrderBulk, ShipmentLoads, WarehousePicking, ShipmentPick, InvoiceOrderApply, FinancialAccountServices,
  AssetReservationMisc, OrderLifecycle, OrderToCashTime, WarehousePacking; BOSS ProductsInventory, ProductsAccess,
  ProductsSharedContext, ProductsVariants, ProductsSuppliers, ProductsTaxonomy, ProductsPricing, ProductsPriceLists,
  WarehousePolicies, WarehouseReturns, WarehouseMoves, WarehouseCounts, WarehouseAdjustments, WarehousePutaway,
  Accounting Payables, Valuation, Reporting, PeriodClose, Collections, Matching, Payments, Settlement,
  ProductionCostClose, ManufacturingPlanning, Materials, Methods, PurchasingAccess, PurchasingReplenishment.
- X4: no Mantle, BOSS or PASS code or spec released a Change hold under `ORDER_APPROVE` other than PurchaseRevisions'
  gate feature (updated); Purchasing approves or cancels a revision through `releaseRevisionHold`, which checks no hold
  permission, and its OrderDetail release is of Purchase holds by `PURCHASE_HOLD_RELEASE`.
- CustomerServiceAccess: 8 features, about 3 s.
- Fixes: **R1** (low) `get#Choices` carried four in-parameters copied from Purchasing (receipt, supplier, return receipt,
  agreement choices Customer Service does not have); removed.
- For the lead: `ORDER_CHANGE_HOLD_RELEASE` now places and releases a Change hold on any order through `hold#Order` and
  `release#OrderHold`, which check no organization or direction (a purchase revision's hold included); P10's release
  must check the hold's order through `check#Record` first, as Purchasing's `releaseHold` transition does. P3's
  Customer360 of a shared customer must list only the user's organizations' orders, cases, returns and invoices.

### P2 — Cases and queues

Design §3 Home, Cases, NewCase, CaseDetail and WorkItemDetail; §9 Settings, Queues, AgentTeams, CaseTypes,
StatusCategories and ServiceDefaults; CS-QUEUE, CS-SETTINGS, CX-REQUEST, CS-STACK (the skills).

- **CS-QUEUE, the case.**
  - A case is a request in a service queue (§4, F5). CaseTypes' service-enabled flag says which types a queue offers,
    and puts a request of that type with a Customer RequestParty and no category into the type's default queue.
  - `mantle.request.support.CaseProfile` (PK requestId): the ServicePolicy row and status mapping it was opened under,
    the template (P7), the accepted intake time, `closedDate` (P8), and the originating communicationEventId or
    emailMessageId. Its organization, customer, contact and assignee are RequestParty rows (§2); the channel is
    `Request.salesChannelEnumId`.
  - The queue: a RequestCategory with an owner field (F6) and effective-dated `mantle.request.support.ServiceQueue`
    rows: offered types, visibility, responsible team, default rule, SLA, template and fallback assignee, active dates.
  - The case rules (D23): a Request create entity ECA rule beside `RequestTriageNotice`, and the same on a move into a
    service queue, calls Mantle's `mantle.request.SupportCaseServices.ensure#CaseProfile` (F41), so Comms, Chat,
    Commons, Projects, email, the public form, the forum and the Support app keep calling `create#Request`. P4 adds the
    episode, P5 the assignment.
  - `mantle.request.SupportCaseServices` (`SUPPORT_CASE_EDIT`): `create#Case` (wrapping `create#Request`,
    `replace#RequestParty` and `link#RequestRecord` atomically with the profile), `update#Case` (queue, priority and
    assignee under the queue's policy, another agent's case with `SUPPORT_CASE_MANAGE`; crosscut's CaseServiceFacts)
    and `transition#Case` (status by the mapping; required resolution; reopen).
  - `ironstone.customerservice.CaseServices`, scoped by AccessServices: `prepare#Case`, `find#Cases` with the Recent
    cases read, `get#QueueCounts`, `apply#CaseBatch` over the Mantle services with a result per case (`StaleCase`,
    `AssigneeUnavailable`, `Forbidden`), and `find#ServiceCustomers`, finding by email and phone (F30).
  - `mantle.request.RequestTag`, dated, over the EnumerationType `RequestTag`.
  - Seeds: `ReqWaitingCustomer` and `ReqOnHold` with their transitions (F4); the priority bands of ServicePolicy.
  - Interim privacy cases (design §8, Admin Open 5): the `RqtPrivacy` type, service-enabled only in a restricted Privacy
    queue whose only members are `BOSS_ADMIN_PRIVACY`. Other agents, general triage and Customer360's counts never see
    it; its verification evidence is protected case files, and each provider's preview and disposition a linked work
    item. When Admin's PrivacyRequests ships, each open case is recorded there with the case as its source (§7).
- **CS-SETTINGS:** `mantle.request.SupportCaseServices` `save#ServiceQueue`, `save#ServiceRequestType`,
  `save#CaseStatusMapping`, `save#CaseWorkflow` and `save#ServiceDefaults` (`SUPPORT_POLICY_EDIT`), and
  `save#ServiceTeamMember` (`SUPPORT_CASE_MANAGE`), over effective-dated rows: `mantle.request.support.ServicePolicy` by
  organization (enabled types, default queue, priority bands, unknown-sender policy, reopen window, auto-close delay,
  required resolution, support-work completion, and `customerImmediateCancel`, off by default, for P10), and
  `CaseStatusMapping` by workflow and status (agent and customer labels, category, pause reasons, order).
  `ironstone.customerservice.ConfigurationServices` keeps `find#ServiceQueues` and `get#ServiceTeam` for the settings
  forms. The default mapping of design StatusCategories is seeded.
- **CX-REQUEST.**
  - `complete#RequestFromWork`: a case only notifies its assignee, beside Purchasing P10's type check; Projects' types
    complete as today.
  - The paths around a case (F8): Projects' and Commons' RequestDetail hide Complete and Cancel on a case for a user
    without `SUPPORT_CASE_EDIT` and link CaseDetail; `triage#Request`, `set#RequestStatus`, `bulk#Requests` and
    `ClientServices.cancel#ClientRequest` refuse a case's resolution or route it through Mantle's `transition#Case`.
  - The audit log on Request's type, category, priority, due date and resolution.
- **Screens:**
  - Cases: CaseFind, CaseList with the saved views of design Cases (SLA risk from P4), the board by status category
    with an equivalent row action, and BulkCaseAction for assign, status and tags (reply in P5).
  - NewCase: CaseIdentity, CaseDescription and SubmitCase, with the duplicate warning over Recent cases. Template fields
    come in P7, knowledge suggestions in P12.
  - CaseDetail: Projects' `Shared/RequestDetail` with the Customer Service row of crosscut §3.11 (F7): Conversation
    first, Overview with the customer and people, linked records, Work, Files, Items when present, and the Recent cases
    pane. Reply and notes through Chatter; assign, priority and queue through `update#Case`; resolve and reopen through
    `transition#Case`; link records; make or link work. Later phases add the clocks (P4), saved replies (P5), merge and
    split (P8), the RMA, order-change and warranty actions (P9–P11) and Knowledge (P12).
  - WorkItemDetail: `Shared/WorkItemDetail` at `CustomerService/Cases/WorkItemDetail` with the row of crosscut §3.12.
  - Settings: SettingLinks with readiness; Queues (QueueList as a tree with a table, QueueEdit); AgentTeams
    (TeamMembers, with participation in P5); CaseTypes (ServiceTypes); StatusCategories (CaseStatusMap,
    CaseTransitionPolicy); ServiceDefaults (ServicePolicy; FeedbackDeliveryPolicy in P13).
  - Home: MyCases, TeamQueues and the New case shortcut.
- **Shell:** the case palette type; quick create New case; the assignment and customer-reply notification topics; the
  Today source of own due and overdue cases, in place of Commons Today's request rows for a case (F9).
- **Assist** (CS-STACK, L1; design §1 Stack contributions): the case-reply and case-summary procedure skills in mr-boss
  `skill/` with their `screens:`, `skill/aliases.json` and `test/skill-retrieval.json`.
- **Usable when:**
  - an agent creates a case for CustJqp in the Support queue from NewCase, sees CustJqp's other open case as a possible
    duplicate, and opens it in CaseDetail with the customer, queue and priority band;
  - a request a customer contact files through Chat into the Support queue becomes a case with its profile; an
    employee's Commons QuickRequest stays a plain request;
  - a manager moves a case to Waiting for customer on the board and by the row action, and the customer label differs
    from the agent label;
  - a bulk assignment of three cases, one of another organization, names it Forbidden and assigns the other two;
  - completing a case's linked work notifies its assignee and leaves it open; a Projects request completes from its
    work as before;
  - Commons' Resolve on a case is hidden for a user without `SUPPORT_CASE_EDIT`;
  - a privacy request filed as a case lands in the Privacy queue, and a general agent sees neither it nor its count.

### P3 — Customers and orders

Design §4 and §6's Availability mounts; CS-SHARED. Customer Service's context on screens other apps built.

- **Reads.**
  - `CaseServices.find#ServiceOrders`: an exact ID, display ID or external ID first, then customer, email, phone,
    product and date; a missing and a forbidden ID give the same answer (F30).
  - The customer's credit status through Accounting's built `mantle.account.CreditServices.get#CustomerCreditStatus`
    (AC-11, F36), which answers the hold and its reason only to a holder of `CUSTOMER_CREDIT_VIEW`.
  - Resend the original confirmation (F29): the order's confirmation PDF stored as OrderContent at placement, sent
    through `send#EmailDraft` to a checked recipient, recording the recipient, the version and the result; an order with
    none renders as of its placed revision and stores it.
- **Screens** (design §4, §6):
  - Customers: CustomerFind and CustomerList, with the hold reason read only.
  - Customer360: Accounting's `Shared/Customer360` with the Customer Service row of crosscut §3.2: Overview and
    contacts, Cases, Orders and shipments, Activities, Files, and the permitted billing summary; Shipping defaults with
    party authority. Later phases add Returns (P9), Delivered items (P11) and Service (P14, with ServiceAgreements).
    PaymentDetails stays hidden; PartyIdentifications and TaxRegistrations are read only.
  - ContactDetail: the Commons contact record with the row of crosscut §3.1. Its Support invitation comes in P15, for
    a holder of `SUPPORT_CONTACT_INVITE` only.
  - Orders: OrderLookup and OrderResults.
  - OrderDetail: `Shared/OrderDetail` with a Customer Service branch beside its Accounting and Warehouse ones (F35)
    and the Customer Service row of crosscut §3.6: Header, Items,
    Fulfillment and tracking, permitted money, History, Cases; new linked case and resend; the hold and its reason read
    only. Returns (P9) and changes (P10) come with their phases.
  - ShipmentDetail: Accounting's `Shared/ShipmentDetail` with the row of crosscut §3.8; copy tracking link and send an
    update; no stock action.
  - InvoiceDetail: Projects' `Shared/InvoiceDetail` with the row of crosscut §3.16; send a copy through Accounting's
    `send#Invoice`, with its pay link; no correction.
  - InventoryAvailability: Products' screen with the row of crosscut §3.7 for customer-serving facilities; a projection
    that is not ready shows unknown, never zero (F31).
  - StockAtDate: Warehouse's `Shared/StockAtDate` with the row of crosscut §3.26; its forms are in design-warehouse
    §14.
  - Product360: Products' screen with the row of crosscut §3.5: no cost or supplier price.
  - CaseDetail's linked records list orders, shipments and invoices, each opening the Customer Service mount.
- **Palette:** customers by name, email and phone, and orders by ID, through the scoped reads.
- **Usable when:**
  - an agent finds CustJqp by email, opens Customer360 and sees the open case and the orders, with no payment details,
    and a held order's reason read only;
  - an order ID of another organization and a missing ID give the same answer;
  - from OrderDetail the agent links the delivered order to a case and resends its confirmation; the send records the
    recipient and the confirmation's version, and a second resend is a second record, not a re-render;
  - InventoryAvailability for a product whose projection is not ready says unknown;
  - StockAtDate answers the quantity at a past cut-off for ZIRET_WH;
  - Product360 shows no cost or supplier price, and a reader without price read sees no PriceExplain.

### P4 — Service levels

Design §3 CaseDetail's clocks, §7 CaseAnalytics, §9 ServiceLevelPolicies; CS-SLA and CS-JOBS.

- **Business time** (F13), Commons' contract:
  - a team's weekly working hours as a `WetAvailable` work effort of the team party, by dated rows, stored through
    `mantle.work.CalendarServices.store#WorkingHours` for a person or a team; the team's manager edits them on
    AgentTeams through Commons' `store#WorkingHours`, which keeps its forms and calls it;
  - `mantle.work.CalendarServices.get#BusinessTimeDue` and `get#BusinessTimeElapsed`, to the minute in the schedule's
    time zone, less the organization's `WepHoliday` days, reusable by Projects and Manufacturing.
- **CS-SLA.**
  - `mantle.request.support.ServiceLevelPolicy` and `ServiceLevelTarget`, effective-dated rows by organization with
    their key fields audit-logged: conditions (queue, type, customer, agreement), precedence, calendar, targets per
    priority band, warning offsets, pauses and the reopen policy. No version record (§2).
  - `CaseSlaEpisode` and `CaseSlaEvent`, records of their own because they are measurements: the policy row and
    calendar used, start, due and actual times, pauses with reasons, breaches, and reasoned corrections that keep the
    earlier figure. A holiday edit changes no stored deadline.
  - `mantle.request.SlaServices`: `find#Policies`, `save#Policy` (`SUPPORT_POLICY_EDIT`), `simulate#Policy`,
    `start#CaseEpisode` (from `ensure#CaseProfile`), `record#CaseEvent`, `correct#CaseSla` (`SUPPORT_CASE_MANAGE`),
    `get#CaseSlaHistory` and `scan#CaseSla`.
  - The D23 rules: a Request status entity ECA rule records every status change of a case, and a RequestCommEvent create
    rule records an outward response or a customer reply. A sent external reply fulfills first response once the channel
    accepts it; an acknowledgement, a note or a failed send does not. Making or linking work is an event.
  - Policy selection at intake by §4's precedence, refusing equally ranked published overlaps; the row is bound to the
    episode, and a later publish does not re-select it.
  - `responseRequiredDate` mirrors the current resolution due date, and only SlaServices writes it on a case (F8).
  - Pause and resume with a reason, resolve, and reopen as a new resolution episode, through `transition#Case`; first
    response never restarts.
  - The agreement condition reads a service agreement type seeded here (F32).
- **CS-JOBS:** the warning and breach scan, a ServiceJob over a bounded batch, a failing case logged with its ID and the
  rest going on, idempotent by case and episode; the SLA warning and breach notification topics.
- **Screens:** ServiceLevelPolicies (SlaPolicyList, SlaPolicyEdit, SlaSimulation); CaseDetail's clocks beside the
  header and its SLA tab; CaseAnalytics (CaseMetrics); Cases' SLA risk view; Home's SLA compliance, first response and
  resolution measures; AgentTeams' working hours.
- **Usable when** (design §10, case intake to resolution):
  - a case received Friday 16:30 on a queue with a Monday-to-Friday 9:00–17:00 team and a holiday Monday is due for
    first response on Tuesday, as SlaSimulation said;
  - an internal note does not meet first response; a sent reply does; a failed send does not;
  - waiting for the customer pauses resolution, and an internal hold does not;
  - a status change made through Projects' `triage#Request` on a case records its event, and Commons' due-date edit is
    refused on it;
  - a reopen starts a new resolution episode and keeps the first breach;
  - a policy row started from a date leaves an open case on the row it began with;
  - a scan with one failing case names it and warns the rest.

### P5 — Assignment and saved replies

Design §9 AgentTeams, AssignmentRules and SavedReplies; Cases' bulk reply; CS-ASSIGNMENT, CS-REPLIES,
CS-FORM-ELEMENTS (the condition rows).

- **CS-ASSIGNMENT.**
  - Team participation: effective-dated rows by team and agent (eligibility, maximum active cases, substitute) beside
    P2's membership.
  - `mantle.request.support.ServiceAssignmentRule`, effective-dated rows with their key fields audit-logged: queue,
    priority, typed conditions (allowlisted field, operator and value), distribution (manual, round robin, least open),
    eligible team or users, schedule and maximum load, fallback. One winning rule, then the fallback.
  - The assignment cursor, a record of its own, locked with the assignment so two intakes cannot take the same slot.
  - `mantle.request.SupportCaseServices`: `assign#Case` evaluates the rules, called from `ensure#CaseProfile` and
    `update#Case` (F41); `save#AssignmentRule` (`SUPPORT_POLICY_EDIT`) and `preview#Assignment`, the preview through
    the same evaluator. `ironstone.customerservice.AssignmentServices.find#Rules` lists them for AssignmentRules.
    Reassignment never resets the clock; no eligible agent leaves the case unassigned and notifies the manager.
    Presence is a hint; the schedule is P4's.
- **The condition rows** (CS-FORM-ELEMENTS): an editable `form-list` with a terminal twin, or the framework element P0
  calls for, under style-guide §8.1.
- **Who is viewing** (§4), only if P0 found the Dev AIDE presence generalizes at small cost: a record viewers topic on
  the notification WebSocket in the framework, CaseDetail's viewers, and a warning before Send when another agent is
  composing a reply to the same case. Commons presence stays user status only.
- **CS-REPLIES.**
  - A saved reply is a Comms text block (D24): personal by its owner, team by the team's UserGroup, which AgentTeams
    keeps in step with the membership (F3), global by the root user group.
  - `mantle.request.support.SavedReplyAction` rows and the language and variables extension, keyed by
    `emailTextBlockId`.
  - `mantle.request.SupportCaseServices` `preview#SavedReply` and `apply#SavedReply` (`SUPPORT_CASE_EDIT`), reading
    the framework's EmailTextBlock; `ironstone.customerservice.ReplyServices.save#SavedReplyAction` for SavedReplies,
    which saves the text through Comms' `org.moqui.comms.MailSettingsServices.store#TextBlock`. An unsupported variable
    is an error, not an empty value. The case changes commit per case; the message keeps a durable pending or failed
    state by its message ID.
- **Screens:** AgentTeams' TeamParticipation; AssignmentRules (AssignmentRuleList, AssignmentRuleEdit,
  AssignmentPreview); SavedReplies (ReplyList, ReplyEdit, ReplyPreview); CaseDetail's CaseReplyAction, the Compose
  picker's text then the actions previewed and applied on confirmation; BulkCaseAction's reply, with recipients
  previewed per case.
- **Usable when:**
  - round robin between two eligible agents skips the one outside their hours; two concurrent intakes take two slots;
  - a rule with no eligible agent leaves the case unassigned and notifies the manager; a reassignment keeps the clock;
  - a team reply with a tag and a set-status action is previewed and applied on confirmation; a personal reply is seen
    by its owner only; Comms TextBlocks still lists the user's own and shared blocks;
  - a bulk reply to three customers' cases mails each customer on their own thread, and a failed delivery retries by its
    message ID without a second reply.

### P6 — Channels

Design §3 ChannelSessions, §9 ChannelRouting, CaseDetail's Reply publicly in forum; CS-CHANNELS, CS-STACK (the Comms
hooks).

- **CS-CHANNELS.**
  - Mail: the `ErActCreateRequest` rule value names a queue as well as a project (F10). `create#RequestFromEmail`
    files into the queue, the accepted intake time is `EmailMessage.receivedDate`, and threading follows verified
    message references before case tokens.
  - Auto-generated mail (an Auto-Submitted header other than no, Precedence bulk, junk or auto_reply, X-Autoreply) is
    ignored or attached to an existing case only, per route, and never acknowledged.
  - Organization intake goes through the queue route, not ProjIntake's triaged types (F11); the design changes.
  - The public form: a queue's form is the Support app's NewCustomerCase (P15), not BOSS's RequestIntake, which stays
    Projects' form at `/r/<token>` for a project. Here `create#IntakeToken` and `remove#IntakeToken` take a queue, the
    token held as Accounting P18's ExternalAccessCapability on the RequestCategory, and `create#IntakeRequest`'s
    limits apply per queue (F10).
  - ExternalAccess record kinds: Accounting P18 built Invoice and Order (with the `billing` and `supplier` app kinds),
    so `ExternalAccess.js` gains RequestCategory with an intake scope, for a queue's token, and Request, a case its
    customer's contacts read (P15).
  - Chat and calls: the `ScChat` seed; Chat's create files into a queue; `mantle.request.SupportCaseServices`
    `log#CaseCall` (`SUPPORT_CASE_EDIT`).
  - The forum (F12): a route from a PASS site and category to a queue, type and template; Mantle's
    `mantle.forum.ForumServices.create#CaseFromTopic` files a Submitted case into it with the channel, and the case's
    Reply publicly in forum previews and posts through `preview#CaseReply` and `publish#CaseReply`, for a user with
    forum posting rights. No private note is copied.
  - `mantle.request.SupportCaseServices` `save#ServiceRoute` (`SUPPORT_POLICY_EDIT`) and `preview#ServiceRoute`, the
    routes `create#RequestFromEmail` and `create#CaseFromTopic` read; `ironstone.customerservice.ChannelServices`
    `find#ServiceRoutes` for ChannelRouting; acknowledgements through `send#IntakeConfirmation` with the route's
    template.
- **Comms hooks** (CS-STACK, L8): Create case from a mail, chat message or voicemail through `create-from` and
  `ext-action`s in `message-actions`, `chat-message-actions` and `voicemail-actions`, and a `call-context` provider
  answering with the caller's open cases the user may see; mail intake stays the existing `createRequest` action.
- **Screens:** ChannelRouting (IntakeRoutes, RouteEdit, RouteTest); ChannelSessions (SessionFind, SessionList, LogCall)
  over `find#PartyCommunicationEvents` with the service audience filter.
- **Usable when:**
  - mail to the support address makes a case in the Support queue, timed by its received date, with one
    acknowledgement; a reply in the thread files on the case;
  - an Auto-Submitted reply attaches to the case, sends nothing and makes no case; an unknown sender is held for review;
  - a queue's intake token can be issued and revoked, and a project's token still makes a project request through
    RequestIntake; the queue's public form is P15's;
  - a chat message becomes a case with `ScChat`; an agent logs a call on a case;
  - a forum topic escalated through PASS lands in the queue; the agent's previewed public reply posts with no private
    note.

### P7 — Case templates

Design §3 NewCase's CaseDescription, §9 CaseTemplates; CS-TEMPLATES, CS-FORM-ELEMENTS (the template fields).

- **CS-TEMPLATES** on DbForm (§4):
  - a template is a DbForm with dependency rows (source field, operator and value; target field; show or require) and
    an audience per field;
  - a template changes by effective-dated rows (§4), which P13's feedback forms reuse (F16): the framework's
    DbFormField and DbFormFieldOption gain `fromDate` and `thruDate` with their key fields audit-logged, and the
    dependency rows are effective-dated with theirs. A draft field has no from date and Publish starts it; an answered
    field or option is ended, never deleted; label, required and option edits are audit-logged; a field whose type or
    meaning changes, or a change set for a later date, is a successor field from that date. The form renders as of a
    date, now by default, and a FormResponse reads it as of its response time. No DbForm is cloned for a version;
  - a case's values are a FormResponse linked to the case;
  - `mantle.request.SupportCaseServices` `save#CaseTemplate` (`SUPPORT_POLICY_EDIT`) and `validate#CaseTemplate`, and
    the values checked by `validate#TemplateValues`, which NewCase and the Support app share (F41);
    `ironstone.customerservice.TemplateServices.find#Templates` for CaseTemplates.
    Conditions use a typed allowlist and refuse cycles; the server re-evaluates hidden and required fields; no scripts.
- **The template fields** (CS-FORM-ELEMENTS): rendered from the form in xml, html and the terminal, or the framework
  element P0 calls for.
- **Screens:** CaseTemplates (TemplateList, TemplateEdit, TemplatePreview for desktop, phone and terminal); NewCase's
  template step; CaseDetail's Overview with the values as submitted.
- **Usable when:**
  - a "Defective product" template requires a serial when the product is equipment, and the server refuses a submit
    without it;
  - an internal field never reaches the customer-visible variant;
  - a template changed from a date leaves an earlier case's values readable as submitted, with the form as it was
    then;
  - a dependency cycle is refused.

### P8 — Merge, split and closing

Design §3 MergeCases and SplitCase, §9 StatusCategories' closing and ServiceDefaults' auto-close; CS-MERGE and
CS-JOBS.

- **CS-MERGE.**
  - `mantle.request.support.CaseRelation`, a record of its own because it is lineage: source and target, merge, split or
    follow-up, actor, time, reason, evidence references and the SLA obligations carried.
  - `mantle.request.SupportCaseServices`: `preview#MergeCases` and `merge#Cases` (`SUPPORT_CASE_MANAGE`; same customer
    and organization; every case locked; the survivor's clock kept, the sources' obligations and breaches carried; a
    source non-actionable with a redirect); `preview#SplitCase` and `split#Case` (`SUPPORT_CASE_EDIT`; selected
    messages referenced within their audience; the clock from the issue's receipt, or a manager's reason).
- **Closing.** The reopen window from ServicePolicy (§4: 14 days); a reply after it, or after auto-close, makes a
  follow-up case linked by CaseRelation; a cancelled case is only followed up. The auto-close job (CS-JOBS),
  `SupportCaseServices.close#ResolvedCases`, sets `CaseProfile.closedDate`, keeps `ReqCompleted` and is idempotent.
- **Screens:** MergeCases (MergeSelection, MergePreview, MergeConfirm); SplitCase (SplitSelection, SplitNewCase);
  CaseDetail's lineage and a merged source's redirect.
- **Usable when:**
  - merging two of CustJqp's cases keeps both histories with their audiences, the survivor's clock and the source's
    breach; merging cases of two customers is refused;
  - a message split into a new case starts its clock at that message's receipt, and the source stays open;
  - a reply 20 days after resolution makes a linked follow-up case; one within 14 days reopens;
  - auto-close sets the closed date, and a rerun changes nothing.

### P9 — Returns

Design §5 Returns, NewReturn, ReturnDetail, QualityInspection and Approvals, §9 ReturnPolicies; CS-RETURN-POLICY,
CX-RETURNS, CX-APPROVAL. On Accounting P17's settlement and receipt and Warehouse P8 and P14 (F25).

- **CS-RETURN-POLICY**, the CX-RETURNS policy records Accounting §7 leaves here.
  - `mantle.order.return.ReturnPolicy`, effective-dated rows by organization with their key fields audit-logged:
    store or customer group, product category, window from shipment or delivery, authorization validity, self-service,
    reasons and remedies, proof, destination, exception approver, receiptless eligibility, advance replacement or
    instant credit, restock fee rule and cap, instructions; and return reason rows over the ReturnReason enums.
  - ReturnHeader's `customerReference` and authorization expiry, audit-logged; the assignee as a dated ReturnParty row
    (F24). `externalId` and `originId` stay integration keys.
  - The authorization decision, a record of its own (as PurchaseApprovalDecision): the return and its revision, the
    policy row, the actor, the time and any exception.
  - `mantle.order.ReturnPolicyServices`: `find#Policies`, `save#Policy` (`RETURN_POLICY_EDIT`),
    `evaluate#ReturnPolicy`, `find#ServiceReturns`, `find#ReturnApprovals`, `submit#CustomerReturn` (over
    `update#ReturnItem` and `request#Return`), `authorize#Return` (`RETURN_AUTHORIZE`; wrapping `approve#Return`;
    `responseImmediate` N unless the policy allows it and the actor holds `RECEIVABLE_EDIT` for a credit or
    `PAYMENT_EDIT` for a refund; no settlement; the RMA PDF stored as ReturnContent), `close#ReturnRemainder`, and
    `decide#ReturnException` (`RETURN_EXCEPTION_APPROVE`).
  - Eligibility under a lock per source order item, against shipped and invoiced quantities less earlier returns,
    including drafts; `update#ReturnItem` from BOSS goes through the same check (F21). Unreferenced goods only by a
    manager's exception. No fee without a published rule, and with no matching policy the return goes to manual review
    (§4).
  - Cancel before any effect cancels the return shipment approval made (F22); Mantle's `add#ReturnToShipment` field fix
    if Warehouse P14 has not made it (F23).
  - The RMA link: `ExternalAccess.js` gains the ReturnHeader record kind with an RMA scope, the token
    CustomerReturn takes (P15).
  - The `ReturnExceptionApproval` topic, seeded in mr-mantle with approve and refuse handlers over
    `decide#ReturnException` on Purchasing P4's decision pattern (F44).
- **Screens:**
  - Returns: ReturnFind and ReturnList with the views of design Returns; batch authorize and cancel, a result per
    return.
  - NewReturn: ReturnSource, ReturnableLines and ReturnRequest, with the policy preview.
  - ReturnDetail: Accounting's `Shared/ReturnDetail` with the Customer Service row of crosscut §3.18: authorize, Issue
    return label through Warehouse P14's `request#ReturnLabel`, close a remainder, cancel before any effect; receive
    in this context through Warehouse's `receive#ReturnItems` for W, and preview and settle through Accounting P17 for
    F; Files on ReturnContent.
  - QualityInspection: Warehouse's `Shared/QualityInspection` at `CustomerService/Returns/QualityInspection` with the
    Customer Service row: read for A and R, inspect and dispose for W (F38).
  - ReturnPolicies: ReturnPolicyList, ReturnPolicyEdit, ReturnReasons and ReturnPolicyPreview.
  - Approvals: Commons Notifications at `CustomerService/Approvals`, filtered to the service topics, the topic list
    Accounting P6 builds (impl-accounting §4; F14).
  - Home's AwaitingReturns and ApprovalsWaiting and the Request return shortcut; CaseDetail's request RMA; Customer360's
    Returns tab; OrderDetail's create return.
- **Shell:** the return palette type; quick create Request return; the return-decision notification topic.
- **Outputs:** the RMA authorization and instructions with the label, by email and `html-print`; the credit, refund or
  replacement notice through Accounting's `send#Invoice`, pending until Accounting says otherwise.
- **Usable when** (design §10, case to RMA to credit):
  - authorizing an RMA for two units of the delivered order creates the return shipment and no credit or replacement;
  - Issue return label returns the label from the test gateway, and a retry answers the same label;
  - the W agent receives one unit with a second rejected at the dock, then the last unit in a second box; inspection
    releases one unit to a waiting order and scraps another;
  - the AR return authorizer credits only what was received; a second credit beyond eligibility is refused; a
    receiptless credit needs `RETURN_CREDIT_APPROVE`, which `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_APPROVE` holds;
  - two drafts cannot together return more than was shipped; with no policy the return goes to manual review;
  - an agent with the A, R, W and F groups does all of this from Customer Service without the Warehouse or Accounting
    root; an agent alone sees disposition and credit read only.

### P10 — Order changes

Design §4 OrderChanges, OrderChangeDetail and OrderDetail's actions, §6 Product360's substitute; CS-ORDER-CHANGE,
CX-ORDER-CHANGE. On Accounting P10 and P17 and Warehouse P11 and P12.

- **CS-ORDER-CHANGE** on the change Request (§4):
  - the `RqtOrderChange` type; the proposal is the change Request, its lines RequestItems linked to their order items by
    RequestItemOrder (product, quantity, Purchasing P10's unit, ship date as `requiredByDate`), with the line action
    and proposed unit price RequestItem lacks; its key fields audit-logged, and its revision the time of the last
    key-field change. The design's OrderChange, OrderChangeLine and application records are not built;
  - `mantle.request.support.OrderChangeDecision`, a record of its own (as PurchaseApprovalDecision): the proposal and
    its revision, the approver, the decision, the reason, the time and the expiry;
  - `mantle.order.OrderChangeServices`: `save#OrderChange` and `preview#OrderChange` (`ORDER_CHANGE_REQUEST`; Products
    P5's resolver, availability, and the reserved, issued, shipped, billed and paid quantities), `decide#OrderChange`
    (separation by policy) and `apply#OrderChange`, each checking the permission of the change's kind:
    `ORDER_CHANGE_APPROVE` and `ORDER_CHANGE_APPLY` for cancel and substitute, Sales' `SALES_APPROVE` and
    `SALES_ORDER_CHANGE` for the commercial kinds (design §4, design-sales §6); and `find#OrderChanges` for
    OrderChanges and Sales' ChangeList;
  - the commercial revision (design §4, X2): the proposal binds `expectedOrderRevision`, the order's `orderRevision`
    narrowed to commercial changes, `increment#OrderRevision` no longer counting OrderContent, OrderNote and status-only
    part updates behind its crosscut CX-AUTOMATION flag, or `get#OrderCommercialSnapshot` if the flag is refused. P0
    checks whether Sales or Purchasing built it; if not, P10 builds it as Mantle's contract (crosscut
    CX-ORDER-AUTHORITY);
  - the customer cancel (design §4 Customer cancellation, X7): Shop's order page and the Support app (P15) file a
    cancel-kind proposal through `save#OrderChange` with `customerConsentRef` and the store's queue. Under
    ServicePolicy's `customerImmediateCancel` (P2, off by default), while nothing on the lines is reserved, picked,
    shipped or invoiced and the order is not approved, it is applied at once through `apply#OrderChange` with the
    policy as the recorded decision; otherwise the customer sees "Cancellation requested" and an agent decides.
- **`apply#OrderChange`** (D9, D7):
  - the order held through Accounting P10's `hold#Order` with the Change reason and released through
    `release#OrderHold` (F27); every check repeated under the lock. The order desk places the Change hold under
    `ORDER_CHANGE_APPLY` and releases it under X4's `ORDER_CHANGE_HOLD_RELEASE`: Purchasing P3 changes `hold#Order` so
    placing needs the order's change permission, not the release permission (crosscut §1.4), and P0 checks it landed;
  - the cancel kind: `cancel#OrderItem` for the open remainder, which re-reserves the line's remainder on its picked
    stock (Warehouse F262) and sets `ShipmentItemSource.putBackQuantity` where the line drops below what was picked,
    and `reduce#AssetReservation` (F28);
  - the substitution kind, on Warehouse P11's ShipmentPickException: the approved substitute line (a PatEquivalent or
    PatReplacement of the product, passing `check#ProductUsable`, with the customer's consent), the short remainder
    cancelled, and Warehouse picking it;
  - after pack and before ship, since the pack invoice is finalized only at ship (impl-accounting §4; F26), the path
    Warehouse built (WarehouseImplementation P12): the package reopened through `reopen#ShipmentPackage`, which
    releases the in-process invoice lines through `release#ShipmentInvoiceLines` with no RECEIVABLE_EDIT check
    (impl-warehouse F275); the line reduced through `cancel#OrderItem`; and the stock put back through `reverse#Pick`.
    The order desk holds no `SHIPMENT_PACK`, so P10 splits the reopen's work out of `reopen#ShipmentPackage` into an
    internal Mantle service that apply calls under `ORDER_CHANGE_APPLY` and the order's organization; it skips the
    `SHIPMENT_PACK` and user-facility checks, as the reopen skips RECEIVABLE_EDIT on `release#ShipmentInvoiceLines`,
    and keeps the state, confirmation and reason checks. Apply never calls `release#ShipmentDraftInvoice` or
    `refund#OrderPayment`, which need the RECEIVABLE_EDIT and PAYMENT_EDIT the order desk lacks; a refund of a
    captured payment stays an F action. After ship the change is `AlreadyShipped`, and a return handles it;
  - the named failures `StaleOrder`, `StockChanged`, `AlreadyShipped`, `BillingConflict`, `ApprovalExpired`,
    `Forbidden` and `ClosedPeriod`, each leaving the order unchanged;
  - price, quantity increase, ship date, address, ship method and carrier are filed here and routed to the order
    owner, which decides and applies them under its `SALES_*` permissions, never here (§7).
- **Shell:** the `OrderChangeApproval` topic; OrderChanges in the palette; the order-change confirmation email.
- **Screens:** OrderChanges (ChangeFind, ChangeList); OrderChangeDetail, the canonical `Shared/OrderChangeDetail` that
  Sales also mounts (crosscut §2), with ChangeProposal, ChangeImpact, ChangeDecision and ApplyChange, the applied
  change stored as OrderContent; OrderDetail's propose change; Product360's substitute; CaseDetail's request order
  change.
- **Usable when** (design §10, order to short pick):
  - a picker short-picks a line of the order awaiting pick; the agent proposes a substitute with the customer's
    consent, a manager approves, and the order desk applies it: the substitute is priced and reserved, the remainder
    cancelled, and Warehouse picks it;
  - a concurrent pick makes apply answer `StockChanged`, with the order unchanged;
  - cancelling the open remainder of a line releases its reservation and leaves the shipped part;
  - on the packed order, the package is reopened, the line reduced and the stock put back, and the shipment's invoice
    and payment are right afterwards;
  - a customer's cancel before approval with nothing reserved applies at once only with `customerImmediateCancel` on;
  - an approved price change cannot be applied here; a stale proposal names the current revision;
  - a Credit hold placed by Accounting stays when the Change hold is released.

### P11 — Warranty

Design §5 WarrantyClaims and WarrantyAssessment, crosscut §3.2 DeliveredItems; CS-WARRANTY.

- **CS-WARRANTY** on the claim's case (§4):
  - the `RqtWarranty` type; the claim is the case, its product a RequestItem, its asset, order, invoice and agreement
    RequestRecord links. The design's WarrantyClaim record is not built;
  - `mantle.request.support.WarrantyDecision`, a record of its own: the terms and their source, covered, partial,
    rejected or goodwill, the approver, and for a chargeable repair the charge estimate and the customer's consent; the
    sales quote waits for Sales (§4, §7);
  - the coverage basis, by the hierarchy of §4: the agreement first, then the product's warranty at sale, a serial or
    lot traced through AssetIssuance to its order, customer and ship
    date, the term from the product's `PftWarranty` feature, and the coverage end with its source; then goodwill. A
    manual override needs a reason. Products' contract: editing `PftWarranty` on Product360, if Products has not;
  - `mantle.request.WarrantyServices`: `find#WarrantyClaims`, `save#WarrantyClaim`, `get#WarrantyCoverage`,
    `decide#WarrantyClaim` (`WARRANTY_APPROVE` for a rejection override or goodwill) and `link#WarrantyWork`: a
    maintenance-purpose work item (or Manufacturing P11's AssetMaintenance, as P0 settles) linked to the case and the
    asset; finishing it notifies the agent and resolves nothing.
- **Screens:** WarrantyClaims (WarrantyFind, WarrantyList); WarrantyAssessment (WarrantyEvidence, WarrantyDecision,
  RepairLinks); NewCase's warranty template; Customer360's Delivered items (crosscut §3.2 DeliveredItems), opening a
  claim from a row.
- **Usable when:**
  - a claim for the serial of the delivered order shows coverage from its ship date plus the product's 12-month term,
    with the source;
  - an expired claim is rejected, or approved as goodwill with the approver;
  - the repair work finishing notifies the agent and leaves the claim's case open; a replacement goes through a return
    (P9).

### P12 — Knowledge

Design §3 CaseDetail's Knowledge tab, §6 Knowledge, ArticleFeedback and CaseToArticle, §9 KnowledgeSources;
CS-KNOWLEDGE.

- **CS-KNOWLEDGE.**
  - `ServiceKnowledgeSource`, effective-dated rows: space, audience, language, product or category mapping, priority,
    review team and default draft space. Wiki spaces only; indexing never widens page access.
  - `ArticleFeedback`, records of their own: page and version, helpful, comment, case, review decision.
  - `mantle.request.KnowledgeServices`: `save#ServiceKnowledgeSource` (`SUPPORT_POLICY_EDIT`),
    `find#ArticleSuggestions` (the requester's locale first, then the space's language), `review#ArticleFeedback`
    (`SUPPORT_KNOWLEDGE_EDIT`; a task made or linked) and `create#ArticleFromCase` (`SUPPORT_KNOWLEDGE_EDIT`; a
    redacted draft with WikiPageRequest); `ironstone.customerservice.KnowledgeServices` `find#ArticleFeedback` and
    `prepare#ArticleFromCase` for the screens.
  - Suggest edit (F15): an editor saves a draft revision and asks for its review through `request#WikiPageReview`;
    another agent files a task on the page for the space's review team.
  - Send to customer: Compose with the published URL, the Support app's CustomerArticle once P15 builds it and the
    space's `publicPageUrl` before; a draft is refused.
- **Screens:** Knowledge, Commons Knowledge with the Customer Service row; CaseDetail's Knowledge tab; NewCase's
  suggestions; KnowledgeSources (ServiceKnowledgeSources); ArticleFeedback (FeedbackFind, FeedbackList, FeedbackReview);
  CaseToArticle (AnswerSelection, ArticleDraft).
- **Usable when:**
  - a case's subject suggests a published article in the requester's language first; the agent links it and sends it;
    sending a draft is refused;
  - CaseToArticle makes a redacted draft in the service space, unpublished;
  - a reviewed feedback makes a task and leaves the article unchanged;
  - an internal article is never suggested on a customer-visible surface.

### P13 — Feedback

Design §7 SatisfactionResults and ResponseDetail, §8 Feedback, §9 FeedbackForms, FeedbackFormDetail and
FeedbackDeliveryPolicy; CS-FEEDBACK, CS-JOBS.

- **The survey builder** (Commons', crosscut §8; §4): the four shared screens of crosscut §2, `Shared/SurveyForms`,
  `SurveyFormDetail`, `SurveyResponses` and `SurveyResponseDetail`, with the Customer Service context, mounted as
  FeedbackForms, FeedbackFormDetail, SatisfactionResults and ResponseDetail; Marketing mounts all four. A form changes
  by P7's dated fields and options (F16), and a response reads the form as of its time. The rating options' key is the
  score.
- **CS-FEEDBACK.**
  - The invitation is Commons' FormPublication and FormInvitation (`mantle.party.FormPublicationServices`; design
    X16) with the case's resolution episode as its context, built here under the owner-contract rule (§2) if Commons
    or Marketing has not: case, episode, form, delivery state and response; its token an ExternalAccessCapability of
    the form-invitation record kind registered in `ExternalAccess.js`. No CaseSurveyInvitation is built.
  - The delivery policy: effective-dated rows (eligible types and queues, delay, frequency, form, channel, token
    expiry, reminder cap, low-score follow-up team).
  - `mantle.request.CaseFeedbackServices`: `save#InvitationPolicy`, `create#FeedbackForm` and `publish#FeedbackForm`
    (`SUPPORT_POLICY_EDIT`), `create#Invitation`, `submit#CaseFeedback` (one durable response; a repeat answers the
    first) and `record#FeedbackFollowUp`; `ironstone.customerservice.FeedbackServices.find#CaseResponses` for
    SatisfactionResults.
  - The guard: `update#FormResponse` and `delete#FormResponse` refuse a response linked to an invitation (an entity ECA
    rule or an authorization rule, as P0 settles).
  - `CaseFeedbackServices.get#Invitation` for the page: the form version and the case's customer label only, never
    the case.
  - CS-JOBS: invitation send and reminders, bounded and idempotent by invitation. The link is the Support app's
    Feedback page for the case's site.
- **The Support app in mr-pass, its first page** (§2, §4):
  - `screen/Support.xml` under PASS's `Pass.xml`, the `support` app of `PublicSiteApp` with the service organization
    as its target, mounted at `/support` by default; its navigation, readiness and operator configuration on the
    pattern of Accounting P18's Billing and Supplier apps (F43);
  - the `support` app kind in `ExternalAccess.js` `appKinds`, with `SUPPORT_CONTACT_INVITE` (P1) as its permission,
    for P15's invitations;
  - Feedback: the invitation's page, taking its token as PASS's Unsubscribe does; `check#AccessToken` checks it, a GET
    shows the form and never submits, and PASS's throttling limits the posts;
  - the operations `getCaseFeedbackInvitation` and `submitCaseFeedback` in `Schema.js` and `Routes.js`, served by
    Mantle's PassApi for a remote frontend;
  - the `SupportAccess` spec, local and remote.
  - A low score makes an assigned follow-up notification. Comments are private to service management and the
    customer-authorized follow-up, under the shared retention policy (§4); there is no agent leaderboard.
- **Screens:** FeedbackForms (FeedbackFormList, NewFeedbackForm); FeedbackFormDetail (FeedbackFormHeader, FormAccess,
  FormFields, FieldOptions, FormPreview); ServiceDefaults' FeedbackDeliveryPolicy; the Support app's Feedback
  (CaseFeedback, at 390 px); SatisfactionResults (CsatFind, CsatResponseList, CsatStats); ResponseDetail
  (ResponseDetails, FeedbackFollowUp); Home's CSAT measure.
- **Usable when:**
  - resolving a case sends one invitation after the delay; the customer rates 2 with a comment, and a repeat answers
    the first;
  - a mail scanner's GET submits nothing; an expired, revoked or foreign token shows only guidance;
  - the low score makes a follow-up; the framework services cannot edit or delete the response;
  - an answered field is ended, never edited; a changed question is a successor field from a date;
    SatisfactionResults compares one effective period at a time;
  - the same rating through a remote PASS frontend, with only framework, webroot and PASS installed, records one
    response at the authority.

### P14 — Reports

Design §7; CS-REPORTING, CS-STACK (the dataset). Reads of what the phases before recorded.

- **CS-REPORTING:** `ironstone.customerservice.ReportingServices` `get#ServiceDashboard` (complete),
  `get#SlaCompliance`, `get#ResponseTimes`, `get#CaseVolumes`, `get#ReturnAnalysis` and
  `get#CustomerServiceStatistics`: the access filters of P1, an as-of time, time zone and currency, bounded grouping and
  CSV under the same permissions with the export audited. Home reads no unbounded scan.
- **Insights** (design §7, Z10): each report registered with the Insights catalog with Customer Service as its one
  owner; Insights lists and schedules them under this app's authorization and adds no second calculation.
- **Shipped reports** (CS-STACK, L6): a service dataset in `report/*.json` with an SLA-breach alert template over P4's
  breaches, which Insights admits.
- **Screens:** Reports (ReportCatalogue); ServiceLevelCompliance (SlaFind, SlaResults); ResponseTimes (ResponseFind,
  ResponseResults); CaseVolumes (VolumeFind, VolumeResults); ReturnAnalysis (ReturnAnalysisFind,
  ReturnAnalysisResults); Customer360's Service tab (CustomerServiceStatistics, ServiceAgreements); Home's measures with
  the previous period and the My and Team split.
- **Usable when:**
  - compliance leaves cancellations out of the rate and shows them apart, and open cases past due stay counted;
  - response times show median and p90 in business and elapsed time with their counts;
  - a merged case counts once in the backlog;
  - ReturnAnalysis shows amounts per currency and counts an open return as requested;
  - a manager of one team sees only its queues, and the CSV has the same rows.

### P15 — Support app

The rest of the customer pages, in the PASS Support app P13 started (§2, §4), on CX-PORTALS' capability service.
Design §8; CS-PORTAL.

- **CS-PORTAL, the Mantle side** (F41). `mantle.request.SupportCaseServices` customer services, each checking the
  contact's customer relationship or `check#AccessCapability` first and answering allow-listed projections with
  capabilities and revisions: `get#SupportHome`, `find#CustomerCases`, `create#CustomerCase` (with
  `validate#TemplateValues` and the queue's defaults; nothing internal accepted from the page), `get#CustomerCase`
  (outward messages and approved shared files only), `reply#CustomerCase`, `request#CaseReopen` and
  `cancel#CustomerCase`; `mantle.order.ReturnPolicyServices` `find#CustomerReturns`, `request#CustomerReturn`,
  `get#CustomerReturn`, `add#ReturnEvidence` and `withdraw#CustomerReturn`; `mantle.order.OrderChangeServices`
  `request#CustomerCancel`, a cancel-kind proposal through `save#OrderChange` (P10); and
  `mantle.request.KnowledgeServices`' help reads and `rate#Article` over the Support mount's knowledge sources (P12).
- **CS-PORTAL, the PASS side.** Each of those as an operation in `Schema.js` and `Routes.js` (`requestOrderCancel` for
  the cancel), served by Mantle's
  PassApi to a remote frontend, and called from the app's pages through `pass.Facade.call#Operation`. Every operation
  maps to a Mantle service; none to an `ironstone.*` one (§2).
- **Customer identity** (§4). A contact is a PASS public account. An internal user holding `SUPPORT_CONTACT_INVITE`
  (P1) invites them from ContactDetail through a PASS invitation bound to the Support app and the customer
  (`invite#Contact`, which takes an organization only); redeeming it makes the contact relationship Mantle checks. A
  customer administrator, a role on that relationship, gives a contact the organization's cases. Domain matching grants
  site membership only, never a customer relationship (design-forum §5.1). A signed-in account whose own party, with a
  verified email, is the case's or return's customer reaches its own cases and returns with no invitation, through the
  self relationship P15 adds to ExternalAccess `check` (design §8 Access, X6); a Shop buyer's account is the same
  account, and the PASS Account hub links MyCases and MyReturns.
- **Shop** (X7): Shop's "Get help" calls `create#CustomerCase` with the store's queue, its "Request return"
  `request#CustomerReturn`, and its cancel P10's cancel-kind proposal; Commerce's Requests and Returns are
  store-filtered views of these.
- **Privacy** (CS-PRIVACY, X15): the privacy provider registered with Admin's proposed PrivacyServices,
  `SupportCaseServices.preview#PersonalData` and `apply#PersonalDataDisposition` over cases, conversations, case files,
  returns, evidence, feedback responses and channel sessions, anonymizing where financial or stock audit stays, once
  Admin's provider contract is built. Until the PASS Account privacy page and PrivacyRequests ship, P2's interim
  privacy cases take the requests (§7).
- **Links and files.** CustomerReturn takes the RMA's token and NewCustomerCase a queue's intake token (P6), as
  Feedback does, through `check#AccessToken`. Evidence and case files go through PASS's media staging and scanning
  into RequestContent or ReturnContent of a customer-visible type. The return label downloads through the facade,
  streamed by a remote frontend.
- **Help.** SupportHome and CustomerArticle read the published pages of the Support mount's knowledge spaces through
  the site pages' exact wiki binding (F15, F43), with helpful feedback under a per-page nonce and rate limit, and
  Create case citing the article.
- **Notices.** Case replies, return decisions and labels mailed to a contact link to the Support app's pages of the
  case's site, from the URLs Mantle builds for its members.
- The outside-working-hours notice from the queue team's schedule (P4).
- **Screens** (design §8), under `screen/Support/`: SupportHome (HelpSearch, HelpResults), MyCases (MyCaseFind,
  MyCaseList), NewCustomerCase (with OrderCancelRequest for a selected order), CustomerCase, MyReturns (MyReturnFind,
  MyReturnList), RequestReturn, CustomerReturn and CustomerArticle, at 390 px and on the desktop. BOSS gains
  ContactDetail's Invite to support and the Support mount's settings in ServiceDefaults (its queues, intake types and
  knowledge spaces).
- **Demo:** a PASS site for ORG_ZIZI_RETAIL with the Support mount, a JoeDist contact and a JoeDist administrator as
  invited PASS accounts, CustJqp's own account through the self relationship (CustJqp is a person, which
  `invite#Contact` refuses), and token fixtures for the specs.
- **Usable when:**
  - the JoeDist contact redeems the invitation, signs in, sees their cases and replies; an internal note and an
    internal file never show; a colleague's case shows only with the administrator's organization-wide visibility;
  - CustJqp signs in with no invitation and sees only their own cases and returns;
  - a cancel request for an approved order shows "Cancellation requested" and files a proposal in OrderChanges;
  - the contact requests a return of the delivered order's eligible lines, and the server picks the facility and the
    window;
  - the RMA link shows the label; the contact withdraws before receipt, and after it is told to ask an agent;
  - an anonymous sender files a case through the queue's form and gets no case read until verified;
  - a forged, expired or revoked token shows nothing about the customer or the record; an anonymous reader sees
    published help only;
  - the same walk passes through a remote PASS frontend with only framework, webroot and PASS installed;
  - the regression suites of mr-pass and mr-boss pass unchanged.

### P16 — Finish

- The terminal twins, and the server-static sweep, an acceptance test.
- The design §10 end-to-end review, acceptance tests. A Customer Service user with no other launcher is refused cost,
  finance, stock posting and other organizations' records, through URLs, shared contexts, exports, the palette, search
  and notifications. With the W and F groups, the same user works from the shared mounts without the Warehouse or
  Accounting root. A customer contact reaches nothing in BOSS, and nothing of another customer in the Support app.
- The §11 outputs not built earlier: the case summary print, customer-visible and internal.
- The inventories' **Implemented in** columns, the design's Impl column, and Remaining-Work; the mr-pass README and
  `docs/Deployment.md` for the Support mount.

## 4. Decisions

These are made before and during the build. Each one that changes the design is also written into
design-customer-service.md, or into the owner's design.

| Date | Decision | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Customer Service is built last, after Products, Accounting, Warehouse, Manufacturing and Purchasing. It adds its context and callers to what they built for it | The user's call; the five plans assume it. Nov 1: Manufacturing, then Purchasing, then Customer Service; P0 checks that the Manufacturing and Purchasing pieces it relies on landed |
| Oct 28, 2026 | The shared rules of impl-drawers-commons §4, parties by role and changes by effective date and the audit log, apply; Mantle's existing uses of both are kept | The user's call, in the Purchasing plan review (impl-purchasing §4). Applied here in §2 |
| Oct 28, 2026 | A case's organization is a RequestParty in the OrgInternal role, its customer, contact and assignee RequestParty rows; a team member is a dated PartyRelationship; a queue's organization an owner field | Follows from impl-purchasing §4 (answer 7) and the owner rule; the design's CaseProfile organization field is dropped |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Policies, settings, mappings, rules and templates are effective-dated rows with audit-logged key fields; the design's versions and "publish a version" become a row started from a date. Episodes, events, case relations, decisions, article feedback, invitations and the assignment cursor stay records of their own | The plan's choice under the rule above; each phase says why a record stays |
| Oct 28, 2026 | The root group and filter sets as Products and Purchasing: `BOSS_CUSTOMER_SERVICE` as root user group and artifact group, with service checks. Its groups take `MANTLE_USER_ORG` and `MANTLE_PRIVATE_CONTACT`, and `BOSS_CUSTOMER_SERVICE_ADMIN`, with all authz on the root, `MANTLE_ACTIVE_ORG` and `MANTLE_PRIVATE_CONTACT` (impl-drawers-commons §4). The root user group is also the global saved replies' group | Follows from impl-products §4 and impl-purchasing §4; F3. The filters revised in the core-app question review, for every BOSS root |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Customer Service builds the parts of other needs it still depends on: CX-REQUEST's case rules and the support-case rule (P2, P4); the team working hours and business time (P4, Commons' contract); the survey builder (P13, Commons'); Customer360's service and delivered-items forms (P11, P14, crosscut §3.2); the forum queue route (P6). These keep the owner's names, packages and Shared screens | The plan's choice, as the other five plans decided for theirs. Nov 1: the customer credit-status read is built (F36) |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Customer Service builds the survey builder's four shared screens of crosscut §2, `Shared/SurveyForms`, `SurveyFormDetail`, `SurveyResponses` and `SurveyResponseDetail` (P13), and the canonical `Shared/OrderChangeDetail`, which Sales also mounts (P10), each with its context only; the survey names go into design-drawers-commons when its survey pass is written. Otherwise it adds its context to the fourteen shared screens the other apps built | Commons owns the builder (crosscut §8), whose screens no plan builds. The four survey screens and OrderChangeDetail as crosscut's registry has them (Nov 1) |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Internal entry first: agents enter cases and returns for customers from P2 and P9; the customer pages come in P15, except the feedback page in P13 | The plan's choice, as Purchasing's; the design's internal paths are complete without the customer pages |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Public-facing applications are in mr-pass and internal ones in mr-boss. The customer pages of design §8 are a new PASS app, Support (`screen/Support.xml`, the `support` mount), not `screen/ServicePortal.xml` in BOSS; P13 starts it with Feedback, P15 builds the rest. It follows PASS's foundation: its shell and mounts, public accounts with no UserGroup (so no `BOSS_SERVICE_PORTAL`), the facade with Mantle's PassApi for local and remote authorities, PASS invitations, media and request contract (§2) | The user's call, Oct 28. It reverses crosscut D5's ServicePortal root for Customer Service's pages. The same rule moved Accounting P18's InvoicePay and BillUpload into the PASS Billing and Supplier apps and Purchasing P16's pages into Supplier (their §4); the built public pages are later moves (F42) |
| Oct 28, 2026 | What Mantle's Request rules, the jobs and the Support app call is Mantle's: `mantle.request.SupportCaseServices` holds `ensure#CaseProfile`, `assign#Case`, `validate#TemplateValues`, the closing job and the customer services; `ironstone.customerservice` keeps the BOSS screens' reads, settings forms and reports, and calls them | The plan's choice; F41. Mantle never calls BOSS, and a PASS deployment may have no BOSS. Widened by the Q2 row below to every case, policy and order rule |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Customers read cases and returns through the Support app's Mantle projections, so Projects' client checks (ChatterServices, RecordFilesServices, ClientServices) are not generalized here | Follows from the Support app decision; design §8's generalization drops (F18) |
| Oct 28, 2026 | A queue's intake token is an ExternalAccessCapability on its RequestCategory, not a PartySetting | F10: PartySetting is keyed by party and type and cannot hold a token per queue |
| Oct 28, 2026 | The order confirmation resent is the stored one: its PDF kept as OrderContent at placement, as the shared rule keeps a key revision's PDF | F29: Mantle's store email re-renders the current order and needs a store email row |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Phase order as §1: the case spine first (cases, customers and orders, service levels, assignment, channels, templates, merge), then returns, order changes and warranty, then knowledge, feedback, reports and the portal | The user's call (answer 1). The alternative was the order side (returns, order changes) right after P3; the case spine gives each later phase its case |
| Oct 28, 2026 | A case is a request in a service queue: a RequestCategory with a current ServiceQueue row. CaseTypes' service-enabled flag says which types a queue offers, and puts a request of that type with a Customer RequestParty and no category into the type's default queue. `RqtSupport` alone makes no case, so an employee's Commons request stays plain (P2) | The user's call (answer 2); F5. The design's "every service-enabled type" would have made every Commons request a case |
| Oct 28, 2026 | An order change is its `RqtOrderChange` Request, its lines RequestItems linked to their order items by RequestItemOrder (product, quantity, unit from Purchasing P10, ship date as `requiredByDate`), with the line action and proposed unit price added and the key fields audit-logged, and an OrderChangeDecision record. The design's OrderChange, OrderChangeLine and application records are dropped (P10) | The user's call (answer 3); F4. One document, as Purchasing made a quote its PO |
| Oct 28, 2026 | A warranty claim is its `RqtWarranty` case: the product a RequestItem, the asset, order, invoice and agreement RequestRecord links, and a WarrantyDecision record. The design's WarrantyClaim record is dropped (P11) | The user's call (answer 4) |
| Oct 28, 2026 | A case template is a DbForm with dependency rows, and a case's values a FormResponse linked to it. Its fields, options and dependency rows are effective-dated with audit-logged key fields, and a response reads the form as of its time; no DbForm is cloned for a version, and P13's feedback forms work the same way. The design's CaseTemplate, Field, Dependency and Value records are dropped (P7) | The user's call (answer 5), with dated rows over a cloned DbForm per version (design sweep review); F16. One form engine with the feedback forms (D24's reuse) |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Design §14's policy items as it recommends: SLA policy by the most specific of customer agreement, customer, queue or type, and organization default, equal ranks refused, bound at intake (P4); a 14-day reopen window as a ServicePolicy field, then a follow-up case (P8); a merge keeps the sources' SLA evidence and deadlines as obligations (P8); warranty coverage by agreement, then the product's warranty at sale through the coverage lookup, then goodwill (P11); return validity set by organization, no fee without a published rule, manual review with no policy (P9); feedback comments private to service management, shared retention, invitation-linked responses immutable (P13) | The user's call (answer 6) |
| Oct 28, 2026 | A signed-in customer contact is the UserAccount of the contact's party, the identity PASS public accounts will use, so the customer pages are not a third identity surface (P15) | The user's call (answer 7); written into crosscut §8 in the Oct 28 design sweep. With the Support app in mr-pass the contact is a PASS public account itself |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Chargeable repair: P11 records the charge estimate and the customer's consent on the warranty decision; the sales quote waits for Sales (§7) | The user's call (answer 8) |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Who is viewing or typing on a case is later (§7), unless P0 finds the Dev AIDE presence (`set#Presence`) generalizes to a record topic at small cost; then it joins P5, beside the reply | The user's call (answer 9) |
| Oct 28, 2026 | The user's call (plan review Q2): Mantle stands without BOSS, and business logic leans to Mantle (impl-drawers-commons §4). No Mantle service, rule, job, script, data file or spec calls `ironstone.*`, reads a BOSS screen, entity or setting, or names a BOSS group; Mantle checks Moqui permissions that BOSS grants its groups. Moved: to `mantle.request.SupportCaseServices` the case's create, update, transition, call log, merge, split and saved-reply apply, and the queue, team, type, mapping, workflow, defaults, assignment-rule, route and template saves and checks; to `mantle.order.OrderChangeServices` the order change; to `mantle.request.KnowledgeServices` the knowledge sources, suggestions, feedback review, article from a case and the Support app's help; to `mantle.request.CaseFeedbackServices` the feedback forms and follow-up; to `mantle.work.CalendarServices.store#WorkingHours` a team's dated hours. `ironstone.customerservice` keeps AccessServices, the `find#` and `get#` reads, `prepare#Case`, `apply#CaseBatch`, `save#SavedReplyAction`, `prepare#ArticleFromCase` and ReportingServices, and a screen calls the Mantle name after AccessServices. P1 grants `SUPPORT_CASE_EDIT`, `SUPPORT_CASE_MANAGE`, `SUPPORT_POLICY_EDIT`, `SUPPORT_KNOWLEDGE_EDIT`, `ORDER_CHANGE_REQUEST`, `ORDER_CHANGE_APPROVE`, `ORDER_CHANGE_APPLY`, `RETURN_AUTHORIZE`, `RETURN_EXCEPTION_APPROVE`, `RETURN_POLICY_EDIT`, `WARRANTY_APPROVE` and `CUSTOMER_CREDIT_VIEW` | Widens the F41 row above. The contracts take the shared names: `mantle.account.CreditServices.get#CustomerCreditStatus` (P3, F36), `mantle.order.ReturnServices.preview#ReturnSettlement`, `mantle.shipment.WarehouseTaskServices.request#ReturnLabel` (F37) and `ironstone.commons.PaletteServices.get#RecordLink`, BOSS's, for routing (P1). The owner designs' names follow in the design sweep |
| Nov 5, 2026 | Which requests are cases (F62): a request becomes a case when it is Submitted (a Draft when it is submitted), has a Customer RequestParty that is a Customer-role party of the service organization (never an internal party), and has a service-enabled type with no category, or is moved into a service queue; a request with a project and such a customer is a case too, and stays visible in Projects. The rule runs after commit and fires on a Customer RequestParty create and on a type, category or status change | The user's call (P0 review), choosing to include project requests; P2 |
| Nov 5, 2026 | Who is viewing a case stays later (§7): the framework presence frame F72 costs is not built in P5 | The user's call (P0 review), under the Oct 28 row's condition |
| Nov 5, 2026 | P0's other answers as F45–F73 resolve them: bearer links through `ExternalAccess.check`, not `check#AccessToken` (F61); a signed-in contact through ExternalAccessContact (F57); P13 registers the whole Support app (F56); P7's framework work is dated DbForm fields and a dependency entity rendered as `visible-when` and a require form of it, with no new element for condition rows (F69–F71); P10 builds the sales commercial revision behind a flag and calls no `reduce#AssetReservation` (F55, F66); P4 shares Manufacturing's calendar functions (F65); P11's repair is an AssetMaintenance (F67) | The plan's choices on P0's findings |

## 5. Open questions

| Question | Decides | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Further issues discovered during implementation | the affected phase | Record findings and decisions here; the open questions of the plan as written are decided in §4 |

The design's other §14 items are decided in §4; ChannelAutomation and Log time are `later` there and in §7.

## 6. Findings

Design assumptions found wrong or unstated in the code, with the resolution. Where a resolution changes the design, it
is written there too.

| # | Finding | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| F1 | P0: `screen/CustomerService/` has eight flat placeholders: Home, Cases, Orders ("Order lookup & changes"), Returns ("Returns / RMA"), Availability ("Availability lookup"), Customers ("Customer 360"), Knowledge ("Knowledge base") and Settings. There are no Cases, Orders, Returns or Availability directories, and no Approvals or Reports; the root mounts only Chatter and RecordFiles and has no `<shell-providers>`. The `BOSS_CUSTOMER_SERVICE` authz is in BossSetupData's commented block (`ADMIN` always, with `MANTLE_ACTIVE_ORG` and `MANTLE_PRIVATE_CONTACT`). There is no `screen/ServicePortal.xml` | Nov 1: the admin authz is live (BossSetupData, with the `BOSS_CUSTOMER_SERVICE_ADMIN` group); P1 adds the root user group and the ordinary groups. The customer pages are the PASS Support app (§4; P13, P15) |
| F2 | P0: `MANTLE_ACTIVE_ORG` filters Party by owner and OrderPart, Shipment, ReturnHeader and Invoice by party, and nothing filters Request, RequestCategory, OrderHeader or OrderItem (impl-purchasing F2) | Service rows through services (§2) |
| F3 | P0: `BOSS_CUSTOMER_SERVICE` exists only as an artifact group. `EmailTextBlock.userGroupId` is a foreign key to UserGroup, and creating a shared block requires the author to be a member of that group | The root user group (P1); a UserGroup per service team, kept in step by AgentTeams (P5) |
| F4 | P0: Request's statuses are Draft, Submitted, Reviewed, InProgress, Completed and Cancelled; Cancelled has no outgoing transition, Completed goes only to InProgress ("Re-open"). Its types include RqtSupport, RqtInformation and RqtContact, not RqtOrderChange or RqtWarranty. The sales channels are ScWeb, ScPhone and ScEmail. There is no request tag. RequestItem and RequestItemOrder exist; RequestItem has product, quantity, required date, maximum amount and supplier | Seeds in P2, P6, P10, P11; RequestTag (P2); an order change's lines as RequestItems (§4, P10) |
| F5 | P0: RqtSupport is the default type of `create#Request`, Commons QuickRequest, Chat's create, the intake form and the forum's case | §4 (P2): a case is a request in a service queue |
| F6 | P0: RequestCategory has parent, responsible party and description, and no organization. Categories are global, and Projects' intake settings already store them (`store#RequestCategory`) | P2: an owner field, and ServiceQueue rows marking a service queue |
| F7 | P0: `Shared/RequestDetail` takes `requestId` and `tab` only; its context is Projects when `appRoot` is Projects, else Commons, with Projects and Commons links hardcoded. `Shared/WorkItemDetail` is the same. Purchasing P10, Warehouse P15 and Manufacturing P11 add their contexts first | P2 adds the Customer Service context on what they leave |
| F8 | P0: outside Customer Service a request's status, due date or resolution changes through Projects' `triage#Request` (moves and due), `update#ProjectRequest`, Commons' `set#RequestStatus`, `update#MyRequest` and the Edit dialog's "Response wanted by", `make#RequestWorkItem` (which copies the due date), `convert#RequestToProject`, `ClientServices.cancel#ClientRequest`, `bulk#Requests` and `complete#RequestFromWork`, called by the `WorkEffortRequestFromWork` rule | The status rule records every change (P4); resolution and cancel refused or routed on a case (P2); the due date written by SlaServices only (P4) |
| F9 | P0: the RequestTriage and RequestUpdate topic links open Projects' RequestDetail, `get#RecordLink` sends a request with no project to Commons, and Commons Today already lists assigned requests with a due date | P1 routes cases to Customer Service; P2's Today source replaces Commons' rows for a case |
| F10 | P0: the intake token is the `WstIntakeToken` WorkEffortSetting of a WetProject; `create#IntakeRequest` limits by project (30 an hour) and by address (5); `ErActCreateRequest`'s value is a project or empty for the plus tag. PartySetting is keyed by party and type, its value 255 characters | P6: a queue destination for the mail rule and the token, the token an ExternalAccessCapability (§4); the queue's form is the Support app's (P15) |
| F11 | P0: adding RqtSupport to ProjIntake's triaged types puts every case with no project into Projects' triage list, shows it to all of the organization's users through `get#RecordLinkInfo`, and fires Projects' triage notice | P6: organization intake through the queue route; the design changes |
| F12 | P0: the forum's case services are `mantle.forum.ForumServices.create#CaseFromTopic`, `preview#CaseReply` and `publish#CaseReply` (a matching `previewHash`), in ForumIntegration.js; the design's `I.` (IntegrationServices) does not exist. PASS's `createCaseFromTopic` operation already passes a `requestCategoryId`. A case from a topic is ReqDraft, RqtSupport, with no channel, so RequestTriageNotice does not fire, and it is linked by RequestCommEvent and PublicDiscussionLink, not RequestRecord | P6; the design's names and link change |
| F13 | P0: working hours are the user's own WetAvailable (`store#WorkingHours`); there is no team or organization schedule and no holiday editor. `get#NextBusinessDay` and `get#FutureBusinessDay` count whole days less WepHoliday; nothing computes business minutes | P4: a team schedule and a Mantle business-time service |
| F14 | P0: the approvals list is a section of Commons Notifications, filtered by `appName` only; a topic is an approval by its `approveServiceName` and `refuseServiceName`; `get#UserNotifications` accepts a topic | P9, on Accounting's filter answer (its F43) |
| F15 | P0: WikiPageReview approves a page version before publishing; it is not a suggestion. `publicPageUrl` is a WikiSpace URL template, and BOSS has no public help-centre page | P12's Suggest edit; P15's CustomerArticle |
| F16 | P0: DbForm has no version, name or title field (description and purpose only); DbFormFieldOption has no score; FormResponse is nontransactional; `update#FormResponse` and `delete#FormResponse` exist | P7: templates on DbForm (§4) and the dated, audit-logged fields in the framework; P13: the option key as score, the guard |
| F17 | P0: no `ExternalAccessServices` exists (Accounting P18). EXTERNAL_USER is a permission. The client deny pattern's service pattern names `ironstone.(commons\|comms\|projects\|products\|shared)` and a fixed verb list, and ClientWrites walks every ironstone service file | Answered Nov 1: Accounting P18 built `mantle.party.ExternalAccessServices`, and the deny pattern now names accounting and warehouse too (BossSetupData); P1 adds `customerservice` and its verbs; customers never reach BOSS (§4) |
| F18 | P0: client checks are bound to projects: `get#ClientWriteContext` refuses a request with no project, Chatter's client mode comes from PROJECT_CLIENT, and `get#ClientRecordVisibility` shows a request the client filed or one of a client project. A client's file list may include RqCntInternal content (P0 confirms) | Customers read through the Support app's Mantle projections, outward messages and approved files only (§4, P15), so these stay as they are; P0 confirms the internal-content question for Projects' own clients |
| F19 | P0: the borrowed groups (`BOSS_ACCOUNTING_AR`, `_TREASURY`, `_APPROVE`, Warehouse's receive, inspect and quality manager) do not exist yet | Answered Nov 1: `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_AR`, `_TREASURY` and `_APPROVE` and `BOSS_WAREHOUSE_RECEIVE`, `_INSPECT` and `_QUALITY_MANAGER` exist |
| F20 | P0: AppStructure's built-root list (Commons, Comms, Insights, Projects, Products) and TuiRender's (Commons, Comms, Insights, Products) leave out Customer Service | None: no route fixtures; the sweep is an acceptance test (§2 Done) |
| F21 | P0: `find#ReturnableOrderItems` measures invoiced quantity less non-cancelled returns; nothing locks eligibility across drafts; `update#ReturnItem` can raise `returnQuantity` at any status without the ceiling | P9: eligibility under a lock, shipped and invoiced, every BOSS write checked |
| F22 | P0: `cancel#Return` cancels the items and header but not the return shipment approval made | P9 |
| F23 | P0: `add#ReturnToShipment` sets `ReturnItemBilling.shipmentId`, which is not a field | P9's Mantle fix, unless Warehouse P14 made it |
| F24 | P0: ReturnHeader has no assignee, expiry or customer reference, and Mantle has no ReturnParty. ReturnContent is a TODO, which Warehouse P14 adds; RecordFiles does not cover returns yet | P9: the fields audit-logged and a dated ReturnParty, a new role association on the rule's pattern. Answered Nov 1: ReturnContent is built and registered for RecordFiles |
| F25 | P0: approval runs `process#ReturnItemResponses`, which makes a replacement order for RrspReplace whatever `responseImmediate` says; receipt cuts `returnQuantity` to the quantity received, ignores rejected units and runs once when the shipment is Delivered. ReturnToResponseBasicFlow asserts all of it | Accounting P17's conditioned rules and `receive#ReturnItems`, behind their flags; P9 builds on them |
| F26 | P0: the invoice made at pack is finalized, posted and mailed, not a draft (impl-accounting F25); no plan builds InvoiceCorrection | Decided: finalized at ship behind D3's flag (impl-accounting §4); P10 releases it before ship |
| F27 | P0: OrderHold is an existing order status, reachable from Open, Placed, Processing and Approved but not Sent; mr-marble holds through `update#OrderStatus`; releasing to Approved fires the OrderApproved rules again (the email, deduplicated by type, reservations, subscriptions, notify) | Accounting P10's `hold#Order`; P0 checks the release; P10 |
| F28 | P0, read not run: `cancel#OrderItem` has no order-status guard and on a partial cancel relies on a rule; `reserve#AssetForOrderItem` returns before its over-reserved branch, so excess reservations may stay | P10's explicit `reduce#AssetReservation`; P0 runs it. Nov 1: Warehouse F262 makes `cancel#OrderItem` re-reserve the remainder on the picked stock and F277 keeps the rest of a partly cancelled line packable; `reduce#AssetReservation` is unchanged |
| F29 | P0: `send#OrderStoreEmail` renders the order as it is now, and sends nothing without a store and a ProductStoreEmail row; POPC_DEFAULT has none, and store-less orders never send | P3 resends the stored confirmation (§4) |
| F30 | P0: `find#Party` has no customer scope, so empty criteria page through every visible party; Mantle has no order find service | P2 `find#ServiceCustomers`, P3 `find#ServiceOrders` |
| F31 | P0: `get#InventoryProjectedInfo` returns an empty map with a message when search is off, sums AstAvailable assets only, has no incoming purchase supply and does not split purchase lines from demand; the ATP reads return one number | Products P7 and Warehouse P4 own the reads; P3 shows unknown, never zero |
| F32 | P0: Agreement has no statuses (Purchasing P13 adds them), no service or warranty type, and no SLA or warranty term type | P4 seeds a service agreement type for the SLA condition; P11 |
| F33 | P0: PatEquivalent and PatReplacement are seeded and edited on Product360, with no demo; PftWarranty is seeded and ProductFeature has `numberSpecified` and `numberUomId`, with no demo; WepMaintenance is seeded and unused; AssetIssuance has `assetMaintenanceId` | P10 and P11 demo data; P0 settles the repair record |
| F34 | P0: Mantle seeds no sales orders, shipments, invoices, payments or returns; they come from the spec chain (OrderToCashBasicFlow, ReturnToResponseBasicFlow). The customers are CustJqp, JoeDist, ORG_ACME and ORG_BLUTH; ZiddlemanInc is a supplier; EQUIP_AB4_1 and _2 are internally owned serials; POPC_DEFAULT belongs to ORG_ZIZI_RETAIL with ZIRET_WH and wiki space ZZW_RETAIL | P1's demo service places, ships, invoices and pays the orders |
| F35 | P0: `Shared/OrderDetail` reads through Projects' `BillingServices.get#OrderDetail`, which needs a project link, and InvoiceDetail is Projects-only; Accounting P4 and P6 and Warehouse P11 generalize them | Answered Nov 1 for OrderDetail: it has Accounting and Warehouse branches, and P3 adds a Customer Service branch beside them; P0 checks InvoiceDetail |
| F36 | P0: no plan builds `mantle.account.CreditServices.get#CustomerCreditStatus`; Accounting P10 builds the policy, holds and Customer360's Credit tab with no read service named | Answered Nov 1: built (`CreditServices.xml`, under `CUSTOMER_CREDIT_VIEW`, which `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_AR` already holds); P3 calls it |
| F37 | P0: impl-warehouse P14 writes `request#ReturnLabel` bare, under Purchasing's contract; the designs name `mantle.shipment.WarehouseTaskServices.request#ReturnLabel`. `create#ReturnShipment` already makes the route segment, so the label needs a package | Answered Oct 28: `mantle.shipment.WarehouseTaskServices.request#ReturnLabel`, the shared name (§4, the Q2 row); P9 calls it |
| F38 | P0: impl-warehouse P8 defines what Release and Scrap do, not the other five dispositions, Return to customer among them | P9 writes what a customer return needs into design-warehouse |
| F39 | P0: no plan builds the survey builder, minute business time, D23's Request rules or the support-case rule in `complete#RequestFromWork`; Purchasing P10's type check covers RqtPurchase and RqtInventory | P13, P4, P2 (§4) |
| F40 | P0: Manufacturing P11 makes maintenance an AssetMaintenance through `EquipmentServices.create#AssetMaintenance`, with `RqtMaintenance` and a Request linked by `link#RequestRecord`; the design's warranty repair is a WepMaintenance work effort | P0 settles one repair record (P11) |
| F41 | P0: the design runs the case rules from Mantle's Request entity rules but names BOSS services for them (`ironstone.customerservice.CaseServices.ensure#CaseProfile`, AssignmentServices, TemplateServices). Mantle never calls BOSS, and a PASS deployment may have Mantle and no BOSS | §4: `mantle.request.SupportCaseServices` (P2, P5, P7, P8, P15), widened by §4's Q2 row to the settings, assignment, reply, route and template rules (P2, P5–P7), with `mantle.order.OrderChangeServices`, `mantle.request.KnowledgeServices` and `mantle.request.CaseFeedbackServices` (P10, P12, P13); the design's §12 namespaces change in the design sweep |
| F42 | P0: public-facing pages are planned or built in mr-boss elsewhere. Planned: crosscut §5 and D5 put `screen/ServicePortal.xml` and `screen/SupplierPortal.xml` in BOSS with the `BOSS_SERVICE_PORTAL` and `BOSS_SUPPLIER_PORTAL` groups; impl-accounting P18 builds both roots, `ironstone.accounting.PortalServices`, InvoicePay, SupplierBillUpload and the `pay` and `/po/<token>` routes in BOSS's MoquiConf; impl-purchasing P16 builds the supplier home, QuoteResponse, OrderAcknowledgement, `ironstone.purchasing.PortalServices` and `/rfq/<token>` there; impl-manufacturing §7's subcontract view and impl-warehouse §7's owner-stock portals would follow them. Built in BOSS: Projects' RequestIntake (`/r/<token>`), Commons' PublicShare (`/s/<token>`), Unsubscribe (`/u/<token>`) and PublishedCalendar (`/cal/<token>`); Projects' clients sign in to BOSS's Projects screens | Customer Service's pages are the Support app (§4). On Oct 28 impl-accounting P18 and impl-purchasing P16 moved theirs to the PASS Billing and Supplier apps, over `mantle.account.PortalServices` and `mantle.order.SupplierPortalServices`, impl-projects §9 plans the Client app for Projects' clients and its public request form, and impl-drawers-commons §6 lists Commons' built pages as later moves; the crosscut and app designs change when each plan's P0 closes |
| F43 | P0: PASS's root `Pass.xml` resolves a site from its host and mounts the Forum, Account, Members and Sites apps from `mantle.public.PublicSiteApp` (app, path prefix, enabled, target); screens call `pass.Facade.call#Operation`, whose `Schema.js` maps an operation to a Mantle service and its fields, and whose `Routes.js` gives the remote path Mantle's PassApi servlet serves at `/rest/s1/pass/v1/sites/*`. Public accounts hold only `ALL_USERS`, PASS roles are PublicSiteParty rows, invitations are PublicSiteInvitation, and site pages bind exact wiki pages (PublicSitePage). PASS has no terminal UI | The Support app on these (§2; P13, P15); P0 checks how a new app registers |
| F44 | P0: Mantle seeds the NotificationTopic rows its services send on, with no link and with Mantle approve and refuse services (`RequestTriage`, `RequestUpdate`, `TimesheetApproval` in MantleSetupData); BossSetupData sets each `linkTemplate` to a BOSS screen | The topics Customer Service's Mantle services send on (assignment, customer reply, SLA warning and breach, return decision, `ReturnExceptionApproval`, `OrderChangeApproval`, the low-score follow-up) are seeded in mr-mantle with Mantle handlers; each phase's Shell entry is BOSS's link to CaseDetail, ReturnDetail, OrderChangeDetail or ResponseDetail (§2) |
| F45 | P0: Purchasing's decision pattern is built: `mantle.order.purchase.PurchaseApprovalDecision` (mr-mantle entity/PurchaseOrderEntities.xml:22, `supersededDate` in PurchaseApprovalEntities.xml:91) holds source entity, id and revision, organization, decision, date, user, reason, policy row and step, and `operationKey`. `decide#PurchaseApproval` (service/mantle/order/PurchaseServices.xml:312) refuses STALE_REVISION naming the current revision (PurchaseOrders.js:508-509), but only when a revision is passed. The purchase topics use `approve#PurchaseSource` and `refuse#PurchaseSource` (PurchaseServices.xml:539, :558) | P9, P10, P11: the return authorization decision, OrderChangeDecision and WarrantyDecision copy the record's fields; their decide services require the revision on a topic path rather than defaulting to the current one |
| F46 | P0: Commons calls only `approve#NotificationMessage(notificationMessageId)` (mr-boss screen/Commons/Notifications.xml:57); the framework's `decide#NotificationMessage` (base-component/framework/service/org/moqui/impl/NotificationServices.xml:261-305) checks the recipient, parses `messageJson`, and calls the topic service with `recordEntityName`, `recordId`, `message`, `notificationMessageId` and `reason`. Purchasing writes `sourceRevision` into the message (PurchaseApprovals.js:295) | P9, P10: the Mantle handlers take those five parameters, read the revision from `message`, and refuse a message with none; no Commons or framework change |
| F47 | P0: supplier returns are built: `authorize#SupplierReturn` (ReturnServices.xml:1826, `ReturnHeader.supplierRmaId`), `create#ReplacementOrder` (:1846, `ReturnItem.replacementOrderId`); Shared/ReturnDetail's Purchasing branch (template/PurchasingReturnDetail.xml). Nothing links a customer return to a supplier return | P9: a case links a supplier return or replacement order by `link#RequestRecord` on ReturnHeader; no new entity |
| F48 | P0: Purchasing P10 is built: `RequestItem.quantityUomId` and `costCenterId`, audit-logged (PurchaseRequestEntities.xml:22-28). `complete#RequestFromWork` (RequestServices.xml:1357) skips RqtPurchaseRfq and RqtInventory (:1388), RqtPurchase with an OrgInternal party (:1391), and anything with no project (:1395) | P2: the support-case rule goes beside :1388-1395; P10's lines use `quantityUomId` |
| F49 | P0: Shared/RequestDetail.xml:262-320 branches on Projects, Manufacturing (:269), Warehouse (:273), Purchasing (:290, section-include :429), else Commons; its RequestNotFound condition (:430) names those; the Items tab outside Projects is gated to RqtPurchase (:312-320). Shared/WorkItemDetail has Projects, Manufacturing (:415) and Commons, and its transitions hardcode `'projects' : 'commons'` (:68-201) | P2: a Customer Service branch of the same shape and a key in WorkItemDetail's transitions; P10 and P11 widen the Items gate to RqtOrderChange and RqtWarranty |
| F50 | P0: Agreement statuses AgmStDraft, Active, Expired, Closed and Cancelled are built (PurchaseAgreementEntities.xml:102-118) on the audit-logged `Agreement.statusId`, but the services refuse anything not AgrPurchase (PurchaseAgreements.js:130, :144, `expire#PurchaseAgreements` :1314). AgreementType has no service or warranty type | P4 and P11: reuse the status flow, seed a service agreement type, and give it its own store and expiry or generalize the purchase ones behind their default |
| F51 | P0: Manufacturing P11 is built: `EquipmentServices.create#AssetMaintenance` (product/EquipmentServices.xml:79) has no permission, organization or owner check; `request#ProductionMaintenance` (ProductionServices.xml:1218) refuses an asset outside the organization's facilities and inventory types (ProductionDowntime.js:25, :50-59) | P11: not reused; see F67 |
| F52 | P0: Products P2, P5 and P7 are built: `check#ProductUsable` (ProductServices.xml:17) through `check#OrderProductUsable` (:36) from `create#OrderItem` and `add#OrderProductQuantity`; `get#ProductPrice` with `explain` and `priceTrace`; Shared/PriceExplain and Shared/InventoryAvailability, routed through `ironstone.products.CatalogServices.get#SharedContext`, whose SharedContext.js knows Products, Warehouse (:87), Manufacturing (:138) and Purchasing (:207) | P3: a Customer Service entry in SharedContext.js; P10's substitute lines get the usability check through the order services |
| F53 | P0: Shared/InvoiceDetail.xml:90-112 branches on Purchasing and Warehouse; any other app root falls to Projects' `get#InvoiceDetail` (:113), which needs a project link | P3: a Customer Service branch with a customer-scoped read, amounts withheld by §2; closes F35 |
| F54 | P0: `hold#Order` (OrderServices.xml:1285; PurchaseOrders.js `holdAllowed` :458-470) places a hold under its type's enumCode permission, or for OhtChange and OhtPurchase under the direction's change permission (PURCHASE_ORDER_EDIT, ORDER_CHANGE_APPLY or SALES_ORDER_CHANGE); `release#OrderHold` (:1366) takes the enumCode permission only. OhtChange's enumCode is ORDER_APPROVE (OrderHoldEntities.xml:43-52); ORDER_CHANGE_HOLD_RELEASE exists nowhere, and ORDER_CHANGE_APPLY and SALES_ORDER_CHANGE are checked but not seeded | P1 seeds the order-change permissions with ORDER_CHANGE_HOLD_RELEASE and makes X4's enumCode change, keeping existing releasers working; P10 places the Change hold under ORDER_CHANGE_APPLY |
| F55 | P0: sales orders have no commercial revision: `increment#OrderRevision` (OrderServices.xml:2890-2940) counts commercial changes only for a purchase part whose PurchasePolicy sets `commercialRevisionOnly`; `get#OrderCommercialSnapshot` does not exist | P10 builds it as Mantle's contract (crosscut CX-ORDER-AUTHORITY): commercial-only counting for sales parts behind an organization flag, default unchanged, with a test |
| F56 | P0: a PASS app registers in mr-pass `service/pass/Apps.js:7-14`, `screen/Pass.xml:26-27`, an app root with `.xml` and `.html.fancy` pages, `screen/Shared/Header.html.fancy:4-5` navigation, `Schema.js:926-1035`, `Routes.js:165-183`, `Transport.js:25-33` TOKEN_WRITES and `test/MoquiConf.xml:18-25`; in mr-mantle `public/PublicApps.js:7-29` (target and readiness, used by Forum.js :2035-2160), the mirrors `forum/ForumSchema.js` and `script/PassRoutes.js` (kept identical by mr-pass Forum.spec.js:381-385), TOKEN_WRITES in `PassApi.js:6-14` and `PassAuthority.js:9-17`, and a readiness branch like `account/Portal.js:583-594`. No PublicSiteApp rows are seeded; Accounting's Demo.js (:1620-1651, site ZIZI_PORTAL) makes them; mr-pass docs/Deployment.md:171-178 lists the places | P13 registers the whole `support` app (both catalogue mirrors, the three TOKEN_WRITES lists, Header, a readiness service, the demo mount on ZIZI_PORTAL and the BOSS grants); P15 adds pages and operations |
| F57 | P0: `invite#Contact` (ExternalAccessServices.xml:121-138; ExternalAccess.js :256-288) checks the app against `appKinds` (billing, supplier), requires a non-internal PtyOrganization and a published site for the organization, writes PublicSiteInvitation; redeeming writes `mantle.party.ExternalAccessContact` (ExternalAccessEntities.xml:49-67) and skips an app not in `appKinds` | P13 adds `support` to `appKinds` with SUPPORT_CONTACT_INVITE; P15 allows a PtyPerson customer under it. A signed-in contact is checked by ExternalAccessContact, a bearer link by ExternalAccessCapability (§2 reads so) |
| F58 | P0: media staging is Accounting's `Portal.js stage` (:479-508: PDF, PNG or JPEG, 10 MB, scanned), finalized by `Payables.js attachStaged` into InvoiceContent and `SupplierPortal.js keepFile` into OrderContent; nothing finalizes into RequestContent or ReturnContent | P15: a `support` noun and a copier into RequestContent and ReturnContent of a customer-visible type, `stage` moved to a shared Mantle module |
| F59 | P0: PublicSitePage (PublicEntities.xml:89-97) binds exact wiki versions for the roles `guidelines` and `about` only (Forum.js :1949-1978, :3173-3209), served by `get#PublishedWikiPageText` cleaned | P12, P15: KnowledgeServices serves published articles by the same exact-version rule, reusing `get#PublishedWikiPageText` and its cleaning, as a Support operation; not PublicSitePage |
| F60 | P0: `PublicApps.pageUrl(siteId, app, path)` (:47-56) and `sitesFor(app, targetId)` (:58-82) build notice URLs; `send#Invoice` sends without the link and logs when there is no site (InvoiceServices.xml:4076-4085) | P13, P15: case, RMA and feedback notices use them the same way |
| F61 | P0: ExternalAccess.js `records` (:25-63) has Invoice, Order and Quote kinds with scopes, permissions and `resolve`; `check#AccessToken` (ExternalAccessServices.xml:81-99) only looks a token up, with no scope, organization or record check; pages use `ExternalAccess.check` (:174-205) | §2 and P9, P13, P15: bearer links are checked by `ExternalAccess.check` (`check#AccessCapability`), not `check#AccessToken`; record kinds ReturnHeader (RMA) and the form invitation; a queue's public form needs a party-less kind (P6, with F10's queue token) |
| F62 | P0: `create#Request` (RequestServices.xml:17-56) writes RequestParty rows after the Request, defaulting to ReqDraft, RqtSupport, no category and no channel. Entry points (type / category / customer / status / channel): Comms and Commons quick create (mr-boss QuickCreateServices.xml:292-325) RqtSupport / none / the matched sender or context party, possibly internal / Submitted / none; Chat (CommunicationServices.xml:4359) no customer, Submitted; Commons `raise#Request` (commons/RequestServices.xml:268-294) customer optional, Draft or Submitted, with a due date; `convert#TaskToRequest` Draft; Projects `create#ProjectRequest` and the client portal with a project, Submitted; `create#RequestFromEmail` sender as customer, Submitted, ScEmail; `create#IntakeRequest` writes the entity directly and sets channel and project in a second update, ScWeb; the forum's `create#CaseFromTopic` (ForumIntegration.js:505-530) the only one with a category, Draft | P2: the case rule runs after commit (as `queue#RequestTriage`, :1234-1253) and fires on a Customer RequestParty create and on a type, category or status change, not only on Request create; decisions in §4 (Nov 5) |
| F63 | P0: Commons Today's `get#UserTodayRequests` (commons/RequestServices.xml:292-349) lists every open assigned request due by day's end with no type filter; `find#RequestRows` (:82-175) any request of a party role, filer or follower; Projects' `find#ProjectRequests` visible projects plus no-project requests of the triaged types | P2: `get#UserTodayRequests` leaves out cases, which P2's Today source lists; the Commons lists keep cases and link CaseDetail (F9) |
| F64 | P0: every path ends in an update of Request, most through `update#Request` (RequestServices.xml:140-172). RequestTriageNotice is in mr-mantle entity/Request.eecas.xml:19-24; an after rule has `originalValue` (crates/moqui-core/src/service/eca.rs:86-108). Only `statusId` is audit-logged. Refuse or route on a case: `triage#Request` (ProjectRequestServices.xml:365-462) and `bulk#Requests`; `update#ProjectRequest` (:516-581, missing from F8); Commons `set#RequestStatus` cancel and `update#MyRequest` due (commons/RequestServices.xml:423-489); `raise#Request`'s due; `ClientServices.cancel#ClientRequest` (:599-620). Record only: `make#RequestWorkItem`, `link#RequestWorkItem` (missing from F8), `convert#RequestToProject`, `complete#RequestFromWork`. mr-marble's EditRequest screens write status, due and resolution through raw `update#Request` | P2: the refusals in those services, and in Mantle `update#Request` a due date or resolution on a case from anywhere but SlaServices and SupportCaseServices (covering marble); the audit log on category, type, priority, due date and resolution. P4: one after EECA on status, due date and resolution of a case records every path |
| F65 | P0: `get#NextBusinessDay` and `get#FutureBusinessDay` (EventServices.xml:2250, :2318) count whole UTC days; holidays come three ways (organization `allDayStart`, categories, calendar members); `store#WorkingHours` is BOSS's `ironstone.commons.CalendarServices` (current user, one undated WetAvailable). Manufacturing's `ProductionCalendar.js` already computes minutes on a `mantle.work.calendar.Calendar` with a time zone (`calendarOf` :135-200, `endAfter` :370-385, `intersect` and `hoursOf` :398) | P4: those functions pulled into a shared Mantle module that ProductionCalendar calls, business-time due and elapsed on it; a team's schedule a Calendar owned by the team party; Mantle `store#WorkingHours` new, Commons' service calling it; one holiday convention |
| F66 | P0, read not run: a partial `cancel#OrderItem` (OrderServices.xml:1882) lowers quantity and ShipmentItemSource (`putBackQuantity`) and removes reservations only on a full cancel; the SECA OrderItemUpdateCheckReserve (ProductAsset.secas.xml:37) re-reserves `quantity − issued` afresh through `reserve#AssetForOrderItem` (removing all first, AssetServices.xml:847), so no excess stays. Its over-reserved branch is dead (returns at `<= 0`, :878, before `< 0`, :880) | P10 calls no `reduce#AssetReservation` after `cancel#OrderItem` (it would under-reserve) and asserts the rows; supersedes F28 |
| F67 | P0: AssetMaintenance (ProductAssetEntities.xml:730) has audit-logged status, `taskWorkEffortId`, content and order items, `assetMaintenanceId` on AssetIssuance, and is RecordFiles-registered; WepMaintenance is unused. A sold serial is AstDelivered, owned by the customer, and keeps its facility, so Manufacturing's checks refuse it. No entity filter covers Asset, AssetMaintenance or WorkEffort | P11: one AssetMaintenance per repair on the sold serial's Asset through `create#AssetMaintenance`, its work a WepMaintenance task in `taskWorkEffortId`, parts by AssetIssuance, linked to the case by `link#RequestRecord`; WarrantyServices checks organization and customer itself; finishing is AsMntCompleted. Closes F33 and F40 |
| F68 | P0: `RecordFilesServices.get#RecordFiles` (mr-boss shared/RecordFilesServices.xml:111-260) and Chatter's `forFiles` give a PROJECT_CLIENT user every file of a request, RqCntInternal included; `get#ClientRecordVisibility` (CommunicationServices.xml:1859-1960) shows a no-project request to the client who filed it, with internal status labels | P2: `get#ClientRecordVisibility` leaves out cases, so customers read cases only through Support. The Projects leak of internal files is a Projects bug, written into impl-projects |
| F69 | P0: DbForm, DbFormField, DbFormFieldOption and FormResponse are in base-component/framework/entity/ScreenEntities.xml:402-575 with no dependency entity and no dates; `db_form_node` (crates/moqui-core/src/screen/form.rs:447-576) reads through the cache with no date. Only `dynamic="true"` forms go through `assemble_dynamic` (:354), which renders in html, qvt and tui; qvt-static writes a note and xml ignores form-single. `visible-when` exists in qvt, qvt-static and tui but not in ScreenHtml.js; there is no require-when. PASS pages can embed an html form-single but load no framework scripts (CSP `script-src 'self'`) | P7 framework: a dated DbFormField dependency entity mapped by `db_form_node` to `visible-when` and a require form of it, under style-guide §8.1 with the html fallback; templates are dynamic forms; P13 and P15 use the html fallback on PASS with server re-evaluation; `validate#TemplateValues` checks on the server |
| F70 | P0: the audit log works on any entity (crates/moqui-entity/src/entity/field_rw.rs:318-360); changing DbFormField's key would break its options, attributes and FormResponseAnswer | P7 framework (about 100-200 lines plus specs): non-key `fromDate` and `thruDate` on DbFormField, DbFormFieldOption and the dependency entity, key fields audit-logged, an as-of date read by `db_form_node`, `assemble_dynamic`, `getFormNode` (tools_host.rs:620-628) and `get#FormResponse` (the response's date), drafts excluded; the delete-and-recreate `update#DbFormField` retired for dated rows |
| F71 | P0: `dynamic-options depends-on` works in qvt, html and tui, and per row in a non-multi editable form-list, whose tui row forms are the twin; in a qvt `multi="true"` list `dependsOn` is not suffixed `_N` (ScreenQvt.js:272 vs :322), not verified | P5 and P7: no new framework element; the condition rows are a non-multi editable form-list with dependent operator and value options, typed values checked on the server. CS-FORM-ELEMENTS reduces to F69 |
| F72 | P0: Dev AIDE presence (dev-component/dev-aide/src/notify.rs:114-170) is an in-memory per-node map broadcast to fixed groups and not cleared on close, so it does not generalize; the notification WebSocket's `notws/collab.rs` has per-document members tied to the socket (join with an access check, leave on close, cluster topic), bound to Yjs and wiki pages (crates/moqui-collab/src/lib.rs:445) | Who is viewing costs about 200-300 lines of Rust on collab's pattern plus a qvt component: decided in §4 (Nov 5) |
| F73 | P0: ORG_ACME and ORG_BLUTH have no owner; CustJqp and JoeDist are owned by ORG_ZIZI_RETAIL. BossWarehouseDemoData.xml has entity rows to CustJqp that Warehouse's walks rely on (BOSS_WH_SO*, BOSS_WH_RETURN, BOSS_WH_RMA, serials SCN-1001 to 1003); Accounting's Demo.js makes returns and invoices for BOSS_ACCT_ORG. Nothing makes a delivered serialized sale, a PftWarranty feature or a paid Ziziwork sales order | P1: a demo loader on Demo.js's pattern with its own IDs, the Warehouse rows untouched: a serialized product with PftWarranty sold, delivered, invoiced and paid; an order awaiting pick; a packed order; for CustJqp and JoeDist |
| F74 | P1: `Party.ownerPartyId` defaults to `_NA_`, so ORG_ACME and ORG_BLUTH are shared parties, not unowned as F73 read them; ORG_ACME is a shared customer in every organization's scope, as ZiddlemanInc is Purchasing's shared supplier | Kept; CustomerServiceAccess checks both organizations serve it. P3: Customer360 of a shared customer lists only the user's organizations' orders, cases, returns and invoices |
| F75 | P1: adding `customerservice` took a row of the client deny pattern past `artifactName`'s 255 characters | Split into two rows; the next package added there needs the same check |
| F76 | P1: a data file loads in one transaction, so a demo service that commits each record on its own cannot see its own file's rows | The service call is in a later-loading `BossZCustomerServiceDemoData.xml` |
| F77 | P1: a customer's record link stays Commons' until Customer360 is under Customer Service; a sales order, which had no link, opens Customer Service's Home lookup | P3 moves both to Customer360 and OrderDetail |
| F78 | P1: crosscut X4 also names `BOSS_PURCHASING_BUYER` and `BOSS_SALES_CHANGE` for `ORDER_CHANGE_HOLD_RELEASE`; neither is granted, since a purchase revision's Change hold is released by its approval or cancel and Sales has no group. `hold#Order` and `release#OrderHold` check neither the organization nor the order's direction, so the holder may release any order's Change hold | P10's release checks the order through AccessServices `check#Record` first, as Purchasing's `releaseHold` does; the Sales grant comes with Sales |

## 7. Later

Designed, not in this build:

- **The design's `later` rows:** ChannelAutomation (scripted chat, chatbot steps, telephony adapters), and Log time on a
  case through Projects' time services (R-CS-22).
- **Other design items:**
  - external knowledge sources (product documents, the forum, an external knowledge API);
  - the chargeable repair's sales quote and the on-site intervention report (design §14), with Sales and Maintenance;
  - who is viewing or typing on a case (design §14), unless P0 brings it into P5 (§4);
  - the Support app's terminal pages (design §8), when PASS gains a terminal UI;
  - Admin's PrivacyRequests and the PASS Account privacy page (Admin's `later`), which take over P2's interim privacy
    cases.
- **Other apps' contexts:** the Sales rows of the screens Customer Service mounts; Marketing's and People's mounts of
  the survey builder.
- **Other apps' callers:** the order owner (Sales) applying the order-change kinds Customer Service only approves:
  price, quantity increase, ship date, address, ship method and carrier.
- **The rest of the other apps' needs:** crosscut's CX-AVAILABILITY projection beyond what Products P7 and Warehouse P4
  built (incoming purchase supply, held and inspection stock apart; F31); NCR and CAPA in the shared quality model.

## 8. Verification

- **Per phase,** the "Done" rule of §2.
- **End to end,** run `./moq run`, sign in as `john.doe` and as each demo service user, and walk each built phase's
  "usable when" in order; sign in to the demo PASS site as the demo customer contacts for the Support app's, locally
  and through a remote frontend.
- **Design §10 end-to-end review,** scenario by phase, each an acceptance test (`./moq accept mr-boss`, when asked):

| Scenario | Phase |
| --- | --- |
| Product, supplier price, PO, partial receipt and inspection, bill and payment | P3 (customer-safe Product360 and availability); the rest is Purchasing's, Warehouse's and Accounting's |
| Shortage, buy, make or transfer, partial completion | P3 (availability read, with provenance as the owners built it); Manufacturing's and Purchasing's |
| Order, reservation, pick shortfall, pack, ship, invoice and payment | P10 (substitution and the change after pack), on Warehouse P11–P13 and Accounting P17 |
| Case, RMA, partial receipt, failed inspection, credit or refund | P9; a supplier return linked from the case is Purchasing P8's |
| Count with an intervening movement | Warehouse's P10; Customer Service reads availability (P3) |
| Case intake, assignment, pause and reopen, resolution, CSAT | P2, P4, P5, P6, P8 and P13; a customer's own intake and reply in the Support app, P15 |
| Unauthorized actions, cancellations, closed period and standalone use | `CustomerServiceAccess` for each access rule a phase adds; P9 and P10 (cancel and ClosedPeriod); P16 |
| Independent failures, atomic inner operations | Every phase: P2 (bulk), P4 (the SLA scan), P5 (bulk reply), P9 (batch authorize), P12 (feedback review), P13 (invitations) |

- **Walks.** One golden-path client walk for the app in the regression suite; the others, and the Support app's at
  phone and desktop widths in mr-pass, are acceptance tests. No screenshots.
