# IronStone BOSS — Manufacturing implementation

Nov 1, 2026 — plan; P0 partly done (F1–F24, found while writing it); the phase order, supply planning, held quantity,
the shared party-role and effective-date rules, the organization filters, the Mantle boundary, the explosion depth and
its open questions decided (§4); consistency pass: brought in line with the Accounting, Warehouse and Products builds
and the Nov 1 decisions

How [design-manufacturing.md](design-manufacturing.md) gets built, in phases from the foundation to the reports, each
ending tested and usable. This file is kept at a high level, as [impl-products.md](impl-products.md),
[impl-accounting.md](impl-accounting.md) and [impl-warehouse.md](impl-warehouse.md) are: each phase names its scope by
the design's sections and §12 needs rather than restating them, and the design stays the place for screen and record
detail. During the build this file is the log: phase status and what each built, the decisions made, open questions,
findings against the code, and what is deferred.

Today `screen/Manufacturing/` holds six placeholders, and the root mounts only Chatter and RecordFiles. The
`BOSS_MANUFACTURING` artifact group has only the admin authz (F1). None of the design's proposed
services, entities, fields or status items exist in Mantle or BOSS beyond what Products, Accounting and Warehouse build
first. Manufacturing is built after all three and before Purchasing (§4), so these are there to extend:
- from Products: the four Manufacturing groups its P1 seeds; `check#ProductUsable` and the kit components (P2);
  Product360, Supplier360 and InventoryAvailability; the dated methods of M3 (impl-products §4), `WorkCenter`, `WorkCenterRate`,
  `get#OperationCostBasis` and the five shared method screens with the Products context (P8); approved standard costs
  and CostRollup, the explosion's requirements and buildable quantity, and the method and cost permissions on the
  Manufacturing groups (P9; F22, F24); the barcodes, GS1 parse and labels (P11);
- from Accounting: the AC-06 guard in `post#AcctgTrans` and `repost#AssetIssuance`'s dated reversing delta (P2a); the
  CX-POSTING operation record (P2); EquipmentDetail and ShipmentDetail; InventoryValuation; the production GL account
  types and the scrap account (P13); Setup's WIP account check (P19);
- from Warehouse: facility scope and `AccessServices` (P1); FacilityDetail (P2); the posting guard, `scan-input`,
  `density="handheld"` and Move with a run context (P5); `scrap#Asset` and `AssetReceipt.sourceAssetIssuanceId` (P6);
  `generate#TrackingIdentities` (P7); crosscut CX-QUALITY with QualityInspection and InspectionTemplates (P8); the
  vendor-custody facility and SubcontractShipmentDetail (P15); and Manufacturing's own contracts it builds (P16): the
  runs and their own lines (`create#ProductionOrder`, `release#ProductionOrder`), the stock guards
  (`issue#ProductionMaterial`, `return#UnusedMaterial`, `receive#ProductionOutput`, `receive#SubcontractOutput`) and
  `Shared/MaterialIssueReceipt`'s work-effort source;
- from Projects: the timers, timesheets and their approval, the WorkItems Timeline, RequestDetail, WorkItemDetail and
  OrderDetail.

## 1. Scope and order

- **Repositories.** Each is its own git repo:
  - `mr-moqui` (`crates/`, `runtime/base-component`)
  - `runtime/component/mr-mantle`
  - `runtime/component/mr-boss`

  `runtime/component/mr-marble` is read only, for the baseline `SimpleScreens/Manufacturing/Run` screens and the
  Catalog association forms that design §10.2 maps.
- **Scope.**
  - Every `parity` and `new` row of design §2, and the §12 needs they use: M1–M8, M10 and M11. M9 (batches) is
    `later`.
  - The parts of other apps' needs that Manufacturing depends on (§4):
    - Accounting's ProductionCostClose and CostingPolicies: `mantle.ledger.ProductionCostServices` with BOSS's queue
      read `ironstone.accounting.ProductionCostServices.find#CostCloseQueue`, `ProductionAllocationPolicy`, and the
      ProductionCostReview notice topic in mr-mantle's data (impl-accounting §4);
    - Projects' side of the labor cost, in mr-mantle: the production approver rule in
      `mantle.work.TimesheetServices.get#TimesheetApprovers`, and the hook on its `approve#Timesheet` that calls
      `mantle.work.ProductionServices.record#ProductionCostEvent`;
    - crosscut CX-PLANNING (§4): PlanningRun, PlanningSuggestion and RequirementSupply,
      `mantle.product.SupplyPlanningServices` with the make conversion and the buy conversion of an outside-processing
      requirement, and `Shared/SupplyPlanning`. Purchasing's and Warehouse's mounts, and their other buy and transfer
      conversions, stay theirs.
  - The shared screens no app has built: `Shared/ProductionCostClose`, with the Accounting and Manufacturing contexts,
    and `Shared/SupplyPlanning` with the Manufacturing context.
  - Manufacturing's context on shared screens other apps built:
    - Products' Product360, Supplier360 and InventoryAvailability, and the five method screens (BillOfMaterialsDetail,
      BillOfMaterialsExplosion, BillOfMaterialsCompare, WhereUsed and RoutingDetail);
    - Warehouse's FacilityDetail, MaterialIssueReceipt, QualityInspection and InspectionTemplates;
    - Accounting's EquipmentDetail and ShipmentDetail;
    - Projects' OrderDetail, RequestDetail and WorkItemDetail;
    - Commons' Calendar, Approvals, Chatter and RecordFiles.
  - §7 holds the `later` rows and needs, and the rest of the other apps' needs.
- **Order** (decided Oct 28, 2026), the method and the run first, then what happens to a run, then what plans and
  closes it:
  1. the foundation;
  2. methods, then work centers and equipment, then the production policy and reasons;
  3. work orders: the runs and their lifecycle, then their materials and stock;
  4. cost evidence, so every later fact writes its cost event as it is built;
  5. quantities, by-products and loss, then quality;
  6. controlled changes: substitutes, amendments, splits and disassembly;
  7. the shop floor and time, then downtime;
  8. scheduling and capacity;
  9. supply planning, then subcontracting;
  10. the cost close;
  11. reports;
  12. the finish.

  The operator phases (P5, P7, P10, P11) bring their handheld mounts, on Warehouse P5's `scan-input` and
  `density="handheld"`.

## 2. Ground rules

- **The Commons rules hold.** These are impl-drawers-commons §4:
  - failure tolerance;
  - the Mantle-free framework;
  - Mantle stands without BOSS;
  - business logic leans to Mantle;
  - the new XML element checklist of style-guide §8.1;
  - libraries through `libs/refresh.mjs`, and crates against `deny.toml`;
  - the `.qvue` gallery pattern;
  - parties by role;
  - changes by effective date and the audit log;
  - demo data;
  - builds and commits.

  Screenshots come from the BOSS `test/client` spec that Products adds (impl-products §2).
- **Production rows through services.** No entity filter covers WorkEffort, so nothing scopes a run, operation or
  routing by organization (F3). Manufacturing reads and writes them only through services:
  `ironstone.manufacturing.AccessServices` checks the user's organizations, the plant facility (through Warehouse's
  facility scope), the run's owner and the capability group, then the screen or mount calls the
  `mantle.work.ProductionServices`, `BomServices` or `RoutingServices` verb, which checks its own permission, the
  organization by party relationship and the facility by its owner. No same-named ironstone service passes it
  through, and other apps call the Mantle name.
  - `entity` in a design form summary means that guarded path, never a bare entity form (design §1.1).
  - Grants are checked in the services, so they hold for exports, search, the palette, the shop floor, handheld mounts
    and shared mounts. `appRoot=Manufacturing`, an assignment or a hidden column is never authorization (design §1.1).
  - A stock action also needs `STOCK_ISSUE`, which Warehouse grants and its guards check with the facility; an
    operator's assignment grants none.
- **One guarded path for each production fact.**
  - Stock moves only through the guards Warehouse P16 built and WH-POST. BOSS never calls
    `set#ProducedProductQuantity`, `create#ProductionRun` with a produce or consume product, `cancel#AssetIssuance` on a
    posted production issuance, or a generic WorkEffort status update (design §13, D13; F8, F9).
  - Every lifecycle change is `transition#ProductionOrder`, from the Lifecycle dialog, the board, a bulk action, the
    shop floor and the cost close alike.
  - Each mutation takes the expected revision and an operation key on Accounting's CX-POSTING record, and a retry
    answers the first result (design §1.1, M2).
  - Released work is immutable. A method, policy or estimate change reaches a released run only through
    `amend#ProductionOrder`, an audit-logged change to the run's remaining lines and operations (M4, §4).
- **One cost event writer.** `record#ProductionCostEvent` writes every cost fact inside the posting transaction that
  causes it, keyed by source, component and revision. Issues and receipts post through the existing hooks once; labor,
  machine, overhead and outside processing reach the GL only through `post#CostClose` (D12, §12.2).
- **Restricted values stay on the server.** A service leaves out any cost, rate, value, supplier price or person's
  rate the user may not read. Money columns need `ACCOUNTING_VIEW`, which Accounting grants its groups; frozen
  estimates need `PRODUCT_COST_VIEW`, which `BOSS_MANUFACTURING_COST` holds. Nothing is fetched and then hidden, and a
  value withheld is omitted, never zero (design §1.1).
- **Shared screens.** Manufacturing builds `Shared/ProductionCostClose` with the Accounting and Manufacturing contexts,
  and `Shared/SupplyPlanning` with the Manufacturing context. It adds its context to the shared screens
  of §1. Each takes `appRoot` and server-derived capabilities, on `Shared/RequestDetail`'s pattern.
- **Owner contracts.** A contract built here for another app follows that app's design: its record and service names,
  its Shared screen and its capability groups, with its logic in the Mantle package of its records (the rules above)
  and its permissions granted to the owner's groups. A change found while building it is written into the owner's
  design. The owner's own screens stay with the owner.
- **Mantle rule changes keep Mantle's default.** A change to an existing Mantle service, such as the production approver
  rule in `get#TimesheetApprovers`, sits behind its own ProductionPolicy flag, off by default (impl-accounting §4).
  Each ships with a test of its condition and of its unchanged default. A new permission check goes on a new Mantle
  service only; an existing one gains a refusal only behind its flag.
- **Mantle callers stay compatible.** Existing callers of these keep working:
  - `mantle.work.ManufacturingServices`, unchanged (R-MFG-35): `create#ProductionRun`, `get#ProductBomDetail` for kits
    and migration comparison, `breakDown#Assembly` and the display and pick queries;
  - `produce#AvailableAssemblies` and the kit components;
  - the Projects timers and the timesheet approval flow.

  Mantle's ManufacturingServices spec passes unchanged (F20), and so do the specs of Products P8, Warehouse P16 and
  Projects' time.
- **Done for a phase** means all of these:
  - impl-projects §2 "Done":
    - cargo tests for the touched crates, with goldens reviewed;
    - the new Mantle specs passing under `./moq test mr-mantle` without mr-boss, their users in spec-local groups that
      hold the permissions;
    - `./moq test mr-boss` passing, with AppStructure covering the new screens and Manufacturing in its
      non-placeholder list;
    - `moqui lint --screens` clean for BOSS with the Debug binary;
    - the `test/client` walks passing, with the handheld mounts at 390;
    - the inventories' **Implemented in** columns;
  - the `ManufacturingAccess` spec extended to the phase's services and mounts;
  - the phase's walk in §8;
  - its row and **Built** note here.

### P0 — Checks

Verify the design's riskiest assumptions against the code before building. Each result is a row in §6 and, where it
changes the design, an edit there. F1–F24 were found on Oct 28 while writing this plan. The design edits that §4's
decisions call for were made in the Oct 28 design sweep. Still to check:

- **The other apps' state.** Products, Accounting and Warehouse are built; what each left in its §7 for Manufacturing
  is read when the phase that uses it starts.
- **Disassembly's two reposts** (F15): whether Accounting P2a's `repost#AssetIssuance` delta makes the issuance cancels
  of `breakDown#Assembly` safe, and what its `update#AssetAndReceipt` → `repost#Asset` does to the kit receipt's posted
  transaction in an open and a closed period (design Disassembly), for P9's dated delta (§4).
- **The timesheet hook point.** How `approve#Timesheet`, its return and reopen, and a rate change can call
  `record#ProductionCostEvent` without changing Projects' behavior; and whether the production approver rule is only
  the run as the operations' root with the supervisor in a Manager role (F17).
- **Other paths to a run's status.** Which BOSS groups reach `update#WorkEffort`, `add#WorkEffortProduct` or the
  Mantle REST paths for a WepProductionRun, for example through Projects' work-item services (F9, F10).
- **Commons approvals and Today.** The notification-topic approval contract (impl-accounting F43) for the production
  topics, and the Today provider for assigned operations.

**Done Nov 3.** The five checks above are F25–F41 in §6. Their resolutions bind the phases that read them: P9's
Disassembly needs Accounting's `forwardIssuanceRepostEnabled` and a new `forwardReceiptRepostEnabled` on the kit owner's
PartyAcctgPreference, not ProductionPolicy flags (F29–F32); P10 changes no `get#TimesheetApprovers` rule (F33) and hooks
labor cost at `post#WorkEffortCost`'s call sites (F34, F35); P1 built the task and event guards (F37–F39); P15 adds
Accounting's two PeriodCloseCheck rows and MyFinanceWork's runs awaiting close (F26).

Answered by the Warehouse build: a draft's material and output lines are the run's own `ProductionRunLine` rows from
create, each with its routing operation, then the run's operation child from release, and the guards key an issuance
or receipt by operation key and line (impl-warehouse §4); P16b's issue guard refuses a held asset (HELD_STOCK) and a
shortfall (QUANTITY_EXCEEDS_AVAILABLE), also at a facility that allows issue beyond quantity on hand (F12).

### P1 — Foundation

- **Access** (design §1.1, crosscut §1.4 and CX-ACCESS).
  - The groups of design §1.1. `BOSS_MANUFACTURING_READ`, `_METHOD`, `_METHOD_APPROVE` and `_RESOURCE_ADMIN` exist
    from Products P1 and its organization-filter commit, and `_COST` from Products P9 (F22); their descriptions become
    the design's (F2). The new ones are `_PLAN`, `_SCHEDULE`, `_OPERATE`, `_SUPERVISE`, `_QUALITY_INSPECT`,
    `_QUALITY_VERIFY`, `_QUALITY_ADMIN` and `_DISPLAY`, with `BOSS_MANUFACTURING` as the root user group and
    `BOSS_MANUFACTURING_ADMIN` as the admin group (§4).
  - The permissions (§2). Warehouse P16a seeded `PRODUCTION_VIEW` and `PRODUCTION_PLAN` in mr-mantle; P1 seeds the other
    five, `PRODUCTION_SCHEDULE`, `PRODUCTION_OPERATE`, `PRODUCTION_SUPERVISE`, `PRODUCTION_COST_REVIEW` and
    `PRODUCTION_POLICY_EDIT`, and `SUPPLY_PLAN_RUN`, beside them. BossSetupData grants them with `UserGroupPermission`
    rows: `PRODUCTION_VIEW` to every Manufacturing group but `_DISPLAY`; `PRODUCTION_PLAN` and `SUPPLY_PLAN_RUN` to
    `_PLAN`; `PRODUCTION_SCHEDULE`, `PRODUCTION_OPERATE` and `PRODUCTION_SUPERVISE` to the group of that name;
    `PRODUCTION_COST_REVIEW` to `_COST`; `PRODUCTION_POLICY_EDIT` to `_RESOURCE_ADMIN`. It grants `METHOD_VIEW` to the
    new groups but `_DISPLAY`, and Warehouse P8's `QUALITY_INSPECT` to `_QUALITY_INSPECT`, `QUALITY_VERIFY` and
    `QUALITY_DISPOSE` to `_QUALITY_VERIFY`, and `QUALITY_TEMPLATE_EDIT` to `_QUALITY_ADMIN`. `BOSS_MANUFACTURING_ADMIN`
    holds every one. The method and cost permissions of the method groups, `_COST` and the admin are Products P9's
    grants (F22). `STOCK_ISSUE` and `ACCOUNTING_VIEW` stay Warehouse's and Accounting's grants.
  - The artifact group has only the admin authz (F1); P1 adds the root user group and its `MANTLE_USER_ORG` authz,
    as Warehouse's `BOSS_WAREHOUSE_ROOT`, with the organization filters of impl-drawers-commons §4. `MANTLE_USER_ORG`'s
    Facility filter is the plant scope, as Warehouse's facility scope.
  - `ironstone.manufacturing.AccessServices`: the user's organizations, the plants they may work in, their capability
    groups, and a run's or method's owner and facility. Every Manufacturing screen, mount and shared mount calls it
    before the Mantle verb, which checks its permission and organization again. A supplied run, operation, method,
    work center or asset is checked against it (F3).
  - No artifact authorization for the raw ManufacturingServices verbs or their REST paths, nor for `update#WorkEffort`
    on a run (F9, F10).
- **The Manufacturing root.**
  - The menu of design §1.2: the six placeholders renamed, and Routings, WorkCenters, Quality, Subcontracting,
    Approvals and Reports added (F1). Batches is `later` and left out. Each area shows for its groups only.
  - The plant selector, kept as a user preference that never widens authorization.
  - `<shell-providers>` (M1, CX-SHELL): the palette types (runs, product and method IDs, scoped equipment), quick
    create, the Today sources and the notification topics grow phase by phase, as their records are built.
  - The `manufacturing` key scope.
  - `ironstone.commons.PaletteServices.get#RecordLink` opens runs, BOM versions, routings and work centers under
    Manufacturing for its users.
- **Home** (design §3): Summary and Queue, with the counts of later phases null; Kpis comes with P16.
- **Manufacturing demo data.**
  - `BossManufacturingDemoData.xml` builds on Products P8's released methods for DEMO_1_1, Warehouse P16's demo runs,
    ZIRET_WH and the EQUIP_AB4 assembly robots (F19). It adds two line work centers (FcTpLine) whose parent is
    ZIRET_WH, so a run on a line nets against the warehouse (F16); skill types, operators' PartySkill rows and the
    operation templates' skill standards (F18); and a second organization's plant for isolation, as the phases need
    them. Each demo run has the organization as its owner (F14).
  - `BossUsersDemoData.xml` gains a user per capability, a production reader with no other launcher, and a plant
    display user.
- **Specs.**
  - `ManufacturingShell`: the menu per group, the palette, record links, quick create.
  - `ManufacturingAccess`: started, covering organization and plant scope and the groups' permissions through the
    services.
- **Usable when:** the menu renders for each group, and quick create offers only what the group may create. A reader
  sees their organization's runs and methods but not another organization's, in lists, the palette and record links. A
  forged run, facility or asset ID is refused.

**Built Nov 3 (P1).**
- Mantle: `MantleSetupData.xml` seeds `PRODUCTION_SCHEDULE`, `_OPERATE`, `_SUPERVISE`, `_COST_REVIEW`, `_POLICY_EDIT` and
  `SUPPLY_PLAN_RUN` beside `PRODUCTION_VIEW` and `_PLAN`, each with its ADMIN grant. No service changed.
- BOSS access: the eight new groups and the root user group `BOSS_MANUFACTURING`, the READ, RESOURCE_ADMIN and COST
  descriptions of design §1.1 (F2); the root authz `BOSS_MANUFACTURING_ROOT` (`MANTLE_USER_ORG`, `MANTLE_PRIVATE_CONTACT`) and
  the `ironstone\.manufacturing\..*` service pattern on the `BOSS_MANUFACTURING` artifact group; the grants of the plan
  (and `FACILITY_ALL_ORGANIZATIONS` to the admin, as Warehouse's); `manufacturing` added to the client deny pattern; the
  area groups `BOSS_MFG_SHOP_FLOOR`, `_QUALITY`, `_PLANNING`, `_SUBCONTRACTING`, `_SETTINGS`, `_APPROVALS` and the record
  link group `BOSS_MFG_RECORD_LINK`.
- `ironstone.manufacturing.AccessServices` (`get#SharedContext`, `check#Record`, `select#Plant`, `get#Choices`,
  `search#Records`) over `Manufacturing.js`, whose tables later phases extend: `capabilityPermissions`, `recordKinds` (run,
  operation, method, routing, workCenter, asset, facility; a `destination` once a screen is built), `searchFinds`,
  `choiceSources` (plants, workCenters) and `linkPaths`. `HomeServices.get#Home` (all counts null).
- The root: the menu of design §1.2 (the six placeholders retitled and Routings, WorkCenters, Quality, Subcontracting,
  Approvals and Reports added as placeholders, each file's comment naming what its phase builds), `<shell-providers>` with
  the palette source and the `manufacturing` keymap; `template/ManufacturingParts.xml`; Home (plant picker, Summary
  unavailable, Queue empty state, record lookup); `get#RecordLink` for runs, operations and work centers (methods and
  routings once they have a destination).
- F38, F39 guards (BOSS only): `get#TaskAccess` and `check#TaskUpdate` refuse changes to a production run's operation and
  Projects does not find it; `get#EventAccessInfo` does not find a run, so EventDetail and `duplicate#Event` refuse it; a
  run's record link is never a Commons task or event.
- Demo: `BossManufacturingDemoData.xml` (lines `BOSS_MFG_LINE_A`, `_B` under ZIRET_WH with WorkCenter rows, the draft run
  `BOSS_MFG_RUN_A`, skill types, Services' plant `BOSS_MFG_SVC_PLANT`, line `BOSS_MFG_SVC_LINE`, run `BOSS_MFG_SVC_RUN`);
  BossUsersDemoData's `manufacturing.*` users (docs/ManufacturingImplementation.md).
- Specs: `test/Manufacturing/ManufacturingSpecLib.js` (ids, users, `routeFixtures`), `ManufacturingShell` (20 features with their rows)
  and `ManufacturingAccess` (48, sectioned by phase); AppStructure and TuiRender render Manufacturing
  (Manufacturing is in AppStructure's non-placeholder list: its placeholders are found by their label and stay in the
  placeholder feature); WarehouseFacilities' tree expects the two lines under ZIRET_WH.
- Tests run: ManufacturingShell, ManufacturingAccess, AppStructure, TuiRender, WarehouseShell, WarehouseFacilities,
  WarehouseAccess, WarehouseInventory, Tasks, TodayPanel, Calendar, EventDetail, TimeEntries, ClientWrites, ProductsCosts,
  ProductsMethods (BOSS, 412 features, all pass); ManufacturingServices, WarehouseProduction, ProductMethods (Mantle, 26
  pass). `moqui lint --screens`: no idiom or hazard site in the Manufacturing screens.
- Decisions: the restricted areas and their groups above (Home, Work orders, BOMs, Routings, Work centers and Reports open
  to every Manufacturing user); a plant is a facility of type FcTpPlant or the parent of a work center, kept as the
  `ManufacturingPlantActive` preference; the display user is in `_DISPLAY` alone, with no root; no quick create in P1 (P5
  adds the draft work order); methods and routings keep their Products link until P2 gives them a Manufacturing screen.
- Findings (provisional):
  - **F42** Products P8's released methods for DEMO_1_1 are not demo data: ProductsMethodFixtures makes them in specs.
    P1's demo cannot build on them; P2 seeds a released demo method (or the walks load the fixtures).
  - **F43** Warehouse's demo run `BOSS_WH_RUN` is WetTask, while `create#ProductionRun` makes WetEvent (F7). The F38/F39
    guards key on `purposeEnumId`, so both are covered; P1's demo runs are WetEvent. P5 may align the Warehouse demo.
  - **F44** F38's Projects guard also refuses time on an operation through Projects' timers and TimeEntries
    (`TimeServices` checks `get#TaskAccess` need update, app projects). P10's ProductionTime needs its own path or an
    exception for `PRODUCTION_OPERATE` holders on their assigned operations.
  - **F45** Before P1 a run's record link fell through to Commons (WetEvent to EventDetail, WetTask to TaskDetail).
    It now opens Manufacturing, else Warehouse's MaterialIssueReceipt, else nothing.
  - **F46** A Projects team user (joe.developer) has no authorization for `get#RecordLink`; no artifact group grants
    it to the Projects groups. Not changed here.
- **Review (Nov 3).** Checked: the grants match the Access list (PRODUCTION_VIEW to the eleven groups but `_DISPLAY`,
  METHOD_VIEW to the seven new ones but `_DISPLAY`, the admin every production and quality permission);
  `FACILITY_ALL_ORGANIZATIONS` for the admin is §4's "the admin group works in every plant" carried into Mantle's facility
  and stock scope, as `BOSS_WAREHOUSE_ADMIN` (impl-warehouse F84), and gives no stock action without Warehouse's
  `STOCK_ISSUE`. The area groups only deny the root user group and let the capability groups back in with the root's
  filter sets; `rootGrants` reads only root screen rows, so they widen nothing. `recordOf` checks every owner and facility a
  kind names (methods and routings have no facility; an asset is checked by its facility only, stricter than Mantle's
  StockScope). The plant preference is re-checked on every read. Fixes:
  - **R1** (medium) F38: `decorate#TaskRows` still gave an assigned operation `canUpdate` true, so the Commons task list,
    Today's rows and TaskDetail's row offered Mark done, due and priority that the services then refused. It now sets it
    false for a WetTask under a WepProductionRun (the run lookup is authz-free for the purpose only; project names keep
    their authz).
  - **R2** (low) F36: Commons `get#TaskAccess` returned the operation's `actualCost` and client cost (the task roll-up's
    pay-rate cost) to anyone who sees it; the production branch now drops them. ManufacturingAccess's F38 feature checks
    both.
  - F44 also covers Commons' `clockIn#Task` and `add#TimeOnTask`, which check `get#TaskAccess` need update. Timesheet
    views and approval do not check the item, so production time logged elsewhere still shows and is approved in Projects.
  - Specs: ManufacturingAccess, ManufacturingShell, Tasks, TodayPanel, Requests, WorkItems, WorkItemDetail, TimeEntries,
    EventDetail, AppStructure, WarehouseAccess (BOSS, 294 features), ManufacturingServices, WarehouseProduction,
    ProductMethods (Mantle, 26), all pass.

### P2 — Methods

The rest of M3 and CX-METHOD (design §5, crosscut §3.23), over Products P8's records and services.

- **`mantle.work.RoutingServices`, the rest:** `find#Routings`, `find#OperationTemplates`, `store#OperationTemplate` (a
  WepRoutingTask with its standards, center requirement and quality template), and `store#OperationInstruction`, which
  publishes an instruction as a dated `WorkEffortContent` row on the template, its file immutable with a checksum
  (§4); `WorkEffortContent` gains audit-logged `fromDate` and `thruDate`. The required evidence and the quality
  template are audit-logged template fields. Copy operations from another routing makes draft copies with their
  source identity.
- **Permissions:** the method verbs, Products' and these, check `METHOD_VIEW`, `METHOD_EDIT` and `METHOD_APPROVE`, and
  cost read for the estimate (`PRODUCT_COST_VIEW` or `ACCOUNTING_VIEW`), through `MethodPolicy.js`, which Products P9
  moved from group names to permissions (F22).
- **Screens:**
  - BillsOfMaterials: Find, the list over `find#Boms` with kits left out (D15), and NewBillOfMaterials. Clone revision,
    and the legacy import Products P8 built.
  - The Manufacturing context on the five shared method screens: BillOfMaterialsDetail with its Header, Components,
    Operations (the RoutingDetail mount), By-products, Instructions, Cost estimate (Products' CostRollup for this
    version), Where used, Revision history and Notes tabs, and ValidateRelease; BillOfMaterialsExplosion;
    BillOfMaterialsCompare (its amendment action is P9); WhereUsed, with kit usage read only; RoutingDetail.
  - Routings: Find, the list, NewRouting.
  - OperationTemplates: Templates, EditTemplate and InstructionVersion. Archive blocks new use only.
  - Product360: Products' `Shared/Product360` with the Manufacturing row of crosscut §3.5. The BOM tab mounts the method
    screens; cost estimates show only with cost read (R-MFG-37).
  - Approvals: the Commons Notifications mount at `Manufacturing/Approvals` (crosscut §3.15), filtered by its approval topics
    (impl-accounting §4, F43), with method release as its first topic when the organization separates drafting
    from release. Later phases add their topics.
- **Chatter and files** on the BOM (ProductBomContent, from Products P8), the routing and the operation
  template (WorkEffortContent), registered in `get#RecordLinkInfo`.
- **Outputs** (design §11): the BOM and routing print, the explosion and compare as print and CSV, and the BOM and
  routing CSV import with its preview. Each version imports atomically, a bad one is named and skipped, kit rows are
  left out, and release stays explicit.
- **Palette:** BOMs and routings.
- **Usable when:**
  - a method engineer builds a routing from two operation templates, one with a published instruction, and a
    BOM version for DEMO_1_1 whose component is consumed at the second operation;
  - validation names a cycle and an overlapping effective window; the engineer cannot release, and the approver
    releases;
  - released lines cannot be edited, and a change is a draft of new lines that a release stamps;
  - WhereUsed shows the component's parents, and DEMO_PA's kit read only with its link to the Kit components pane;
  - an import of two versions with one bad unit applies the good one and names the other.

### P3 — Work centers and equipment

The rest of M5 and CX-WORKCENTER (design §6), over Products P8's `WorkCenter` and `WorkCenterRate`.

- **Records:** `WorkCenterCapacity` (by product or type, quantity and unit per duration, or parallel slots, dated) and
  `WorkCenterAlternate`, with the WorkCenter fields P8 left out: plant, calendar, efficiency, OEE target and scheduling
  policy. Facility.capacity stays people capacity.
- **Services:** `store#WorkCenter` extended, under `METHOD_RESOURCES`, and its rate under `METHOD_COST_EDIT` and
  `METHOD_COST_APPROVE`, as built; `mantle.work.ProductionPlanningServices.get#WorkCenterLoad` (`PRODUCTION_VIEW`),
  first from capacity and released operations only; P12 adds the calendar, downtime and the schedule.
- **Screens** (design §6):
  - WorkCenters: Find, Centers and NewCenter, on an existing facility or a new FcTpLine;
  - FacilityDetail: Warehouse's `Shared/FacilityDetail` with the Manufacturing context: the WorkCenter extension,
    calendar, equipment, capacities, efficiency, the rate with cost read only, alternates, and Chatter and files;
  - Equipment: Find and the list over Asset and WorkEffortAssetAssign;
  - EquipmentDetail: Accounting's `Shared/EquipmentDetail` with the Manufacturing row of crosscut §3.10: assignments,
    qualifications, maintenance history and documents, and safe-use instructions for a read-only operator. Its
    downtime and request maintenance come with P11;
  - ResourceCalendar: Commons Calendar with the plant and work-center resources, read only.
- **Usable when:**
  - a resource administrator makes a facility a line work center with two parallel slots, a capacity per hour for
    DEMO_1_1 and a dated rate, and a rate needs cost authority;
  - the facility's people capacity is unchanged;
  - an operator reads the center without its rate, and the calendar shows its work hours and holidays.

### P4 — Policy and reasons

- **Records:** `mantle.work.production.ProductionPolicy`, effective-dated rows with their key fields audit-logged
  (impl-drawers-commons §4), with an organization default
  and an explicit plant override (design ProductionSettings): consumption (manual or backflush, issue point,
  over-consumption and overproduction tolerances, substitute approval, quality defaults), time and cost (time-log
  enforcement, machine runtime, work type, piece rate, estimate refresh), and planning (horizon, time fence, shortage
  release policy, calendar, lead-time basis, freshness limit). The production reason codes (design ReasonCodes), with
  category, equipment fault, planned stop and approval threshold, effective-dated. A run keeps the policy row it was
  released under.
- **Services:** `store#ProductionPolicy` and `store#ProductionReasons` under `PRODUCTION_POLICY_EDIT`, and
  `get#ProductionPolicy` with the source of each value.
- **The issue guard's scrap allowance:** `issue#ProductionMaterial` admits an issue beyond the line's remainder up to
  the over-consumption tolerance, which Warehouse P16b refuses today (QUANTITY_EXCEEDS_REMAINING; impl-warehouse §5).
- **Screens:** ProductionSettings (Consumption, TimeAndCost with a read-only link to CostingPolicies, Planning) and
  ReasonCodes. The shortage release policy defaults to all components usable, with staged release by supervisor
  approval (design §13).
- **Usable when:**
  - an administrator sets an organization default and a plant override of the overproduction tolerance, and the
    resolved policy names each value's source;
  - a referenced reason can be deactivated, not deleted;
  - a policy change reaches no released run (checked in P5);
  - an issue within the over-consumption tolerance passes, and one beyond it is refused.

**Built Nov 3 (P4).**
- Mantle: `entity/ProductionPolicyEntities.xml` (a new file, so it merges apart from `ProductionEntities.xml`):
  `mantle.work.production.ProductionPolicy`, keyed by organization, facility (`_NA_` for the organization's default) and
  `fromDate`, every field audit-logged; and `ProductionReason`, keyed by organization, `reasonCode` and `fromDate`
  (name, category, `equipmentFault`, `plannedStop`, `approvalThreshold`, sequence). The seeded enumerations:
  ProductionConsumption, ProductionIssuePoint, ProductionTimeLog, ProductionMachineRuntime, ProductionShortageRelease
  (`PsrAllUsable`, the default: all components usable, with staged release by supervisor approval; `PsrStaged`),
  ProductionLeadTimeBasis and ProductionReasonCategory.
  - Policy fields: consumption (`consumptionMethodEnumId`, `issuePointEnumId`, `overConsumePercent`,
    `overProducePercent`, `substituteApproval`, `outputInspection`, `firstPieceInspection`, and the flags
    `completeOnFinalReceipt` for P7 and `strictRelease` for P9); time and cost (`timeLogEnforcementEnumId`,
    `machineRuntimeEnumId`, `workTypeEnumId`, `pieceRate`, `laborCostSync` (the F34 hook flag P10 reads), `estimateRefresh`,
    `closeApproval`); planning (`planningHorizonDays`, `timeFenceDays`, `shortageReleaseEnumId`, `calendarId`,
    `leadTimeBasisEnumId`, `freshnessLimitHours`). The built-in defaults are Mantle's behavior with no row, and every
    flag is N.
  - `service/mantle/work/ProductionPolicy.js`, with four services appended to `ProductionServices.xml`:
    `get#ProductionPolicy` (PRODUCTION_VIEW or PRODUCTION_POLICY_EDIT). It resolves the built-in defaults, then the
    organization's row, then each facility's row from the topmost down to the given facility. So a line inherits its
    plant's override. It answers each value's source (`sources`, and `traceRows` with display text), the row at the exact
    scope with its `expectedFromDate`, the history and `canEdit`. With `workEffortId` it reads the run's owner and facility
    as of its release time; with `asOfDate`, any other time.
  - `store#ProductionPolicy` (PRODUCTION_POLICY_EDIT) makes a dated change of the given fields. With `policyGroup` it
    changes only that form's group. It refuses a stale `expectedFromDate` (POLICY_CHANGED), a start before now, a second
    row at the same time and invalid values (POLICY_INVALID).
  - `find#ProductionReasons`: the active codes, or with `includeInactive` the inactive ones too; `reasonCode` gives that
    code's history.
  - `store#ProductionReasons` takes a list. It adds, changes (by a dated row) or deactivates each reason on its own,
    and names a refused row in `results` while it stores the others. Nothing is deleted.
  - Internal helpers for later phases: `effective(org, facility, at)`, `runPolicy(run)`, `overConsumeAllowance(run, line)`
    and `activeReason(org, code, at)`.
  - The issue guard (`Production.js` `issuePlan`, a local edit): a line may be issued up to its quantity plus
    `overConsumePercent` of it, minus what was already issued net. The percent comes from the policy as of the run's
    release. With no row the allowance is zero, and QUANTITY_EXCEEDS_REMAINING is unchanged. Subcontract output's own
    remainder check (`subcontractPlan`) is unchanged.
- BOSS: `Settings` became the tab parent of `Settings/ProductionSettings` and `Settings/ReasonCodes`, behind P1's
  BOSS_MFG_SETTINGS area. ProductionSettings has a plant and organization picker and three boxes (Consumption, Time and
  cost, Planning). Each box lists its values with their sources and has a Change dialog that saves its own `policyGroup`.
  Below them is the history of the dated rows. ReasonCodes has an organization picker, an Active or All filter, Add reason
  (the primary action), and Edit, Deactivate (danger, confirmed) and Reactivate on each row. `Manufacturing.js` gained the
  `organizations` choice. BossManufacturingDemoData seeds six Retail reasons and no policy row, so the demo runs keep
  Mantle's issue guard.
- Specs: Mantle `test/work/ProductionPolicy.spec.js` (7 features, about 3 s). It covers the defaults; an organization
  default and a plant override of the overproduction tolerance with their sources, and a line's inheritance; stale,
  back-dated, invalid and unpermitted changes; a group-only change; an issue within the 10% allowance passing and one
  beyond it refused, alongside a run released before any policy keeping the default; a run keeping the policy of its release
  through a later change, with a run released afterwards taking the change (P5's check, ready for it); and reasons stored,
  changed, refused, deactivated and kept.
  - ManufacturingAccess gained a P4 section (3 features: the resource administrator against a reader and the other
    organization; the Settings pages with authz enabled).
  - ManufacturingSpecLib's routes cover the three Settings paths in AppStructure and TuiRender.
  - Client walk `test/client/Manufacturing/ManufacturingPolicyWalk.spec.js` (2 features), added to `suite.js`.
- Tests run: Mantle ProductionPolicy, ManufacturingServices, WarehouseProduction and ProductMethods (33 features, all
  pass). BOSS ManufacturingAccess, ManufacturingShell, AppStructure, TuiRender, WarehouseProductionFixtures and
  WarehouseAccess (230 features, all pass). The walk ManufacturingPolicyWalk passes (2). `moqui lint --screens` shows only
  informational anchor rows for the new screens.
- Decisions:
  - Reason codes are an organization's own dated rows keyed by code, not Enumerations. An event names the code and
    copies the classification of the row in effect at its date, so later changes apply going forward. There is no delete
    service, so "referenced" needs no check. Translated labels are not built.
  - Reasons are edited with row dialogs. The design's editable grid is not built.
  - The resolution walks the facility's parents, so an override on a line under a plant works too. The screen offers
    plants only.
  - TimeAndCost's link to CostingPolicies is a note until P15 builds that screen. P15 replaces the note with the
    read-only link.
- Findings (provisional):
  - **F-P4-1** The design's TimeAndCost "production approver rule" flag is not built: F33 dropped it, since the run's
    supervisor in a Manager role is enough under the default timesheet policy. The design's TimeAndCost row and Actions
    now name the labor cost flag in its place.
  - **F-P4-2** F38's optional Mantle refusal in `update#Task` and `set#TaskStatus` behind a ProductionPolicy flag is not
    built. P1's BOSS guards cover the paths, and no phase asked for it.
  - **F-P4-3** The walks' database outlives a `test-client --serve` run, so a walk that adds a record by a fixed code
    fails on its second run. ManufacturingPolicyWalk uses a code made for each run.
  - **F-P4-4** For P5: `release#ProductionOrder` already stamps `productionReleaseDate`, and no policy row can start
    before now. So `ProductionPolicy.js` `runPolicy(run)`, or `get#ProductionPolicy` with `workEffortId`, is the policy
    the run keeps, with no copy on the run. P5's release gate reads `shortageReleaseEnumId` there. P7 reads
    `overProducePercent` and `completeOnFinalReceipt`, P9 `strictRelease` and `substituteApproval`, and P10
    `laborCostSync`, `pieceRate` and `timeLogEnforcementEnumId`.
- **Review (Nov 3).** Checked: no overlapping rows from either store path; the as-of read at the release time; the
  organization and facility checks (a plant of another organization refused, read and change); the permission checks;
  the issue guard (equal to the old refusal with no policy, the exact allowance passing, a retry answered before the
  plan); nothing deleted. Fixed:
  - `store#ProductionPolicy` read now before taking the organization lock. A change that waited on another could then
    start before it, end that change ms later and so lose its own values silently, and start before a release that
    committed while it waited, against F-P4-4. Now is read after the lock.
  - A reason's deactivation ended the row in effect now, even with a later start, which could stretch that row over a
    later one. It also left a scheduled change to start the reason again. It now ends the row in effect at its start and
    is refused (REASON_INVALID) while a later change is scheduled.
  - The spec covers a plant of another organization (read and change refused, no row) and the deactivation before a
    scheduled change. The ProductionSettings dialog forms are indented under their `form-single`.
  - Left: F-P4-4 holds for the services only. A data load or a direct entity write can still back-date a row, so a P5
    copy on the run would be the stricter choice. The policy and reason saves take `expectedFromDate`, not an operation
    key, as Warehouse's policy saves do, so a retry after success answers POLICY_CHANGED.
  - Specs: Mantle ProductionPolicy, WarehouseProduction and ManufacturingServices (22, pass). BOSS ManufacturingAccess,
    AppStructure and TuiRender (72, pass). `moqui lint --screens` is clean for the Settings screens.

### P5 — Work orders

Design §3 WorkOrders, NewWorkOrder, WorkOrderDetail, Overview, Operations, Components and MaterialIssueReceipt, and the
parts of M1, M2 and M4 Warehouse P16 left. Built in two parts: P5a the runs and their lifecycle, then P5b their
materials and stock.

- **P5a, the runs.**
  - `mantle.work.ProductionServices`:
    - `find#ProductionOrders` (`PRODUCTION_VIEW`), and `store#ProductionOrder` (the draft header) and
      `store#ProductionEquipment` (`PRODUCTION_PLAN`);
    - people through the existing `add#` and `remove#WorkEffortParty`, behind a guarded assignment;
    - `transition#ProductionOrder`: release through P16a's `release#ProductionOrder`, whose release time now reads
      the P4 policy rows as of it; unrelease while no fact exists; start; hold and resume; cancel of an unposted draft. Complete needs P7's
      reconciliation and close is P15's. Each guard checks its design state, refuses the generic `WeInPlanning` →
      `WeComplete` and `WeClosed` transitions, and checks its own permission (R-MFG-11): `PRODUCTION_PLAN` to release
      and unrelease, `PRODUCTION_SUPERVISE` to start, hold, resume, cancel and complete;
    - the release gate: a valid method, `check#ProductUsable`, a later release of the method found with a re-explosion
      offered,
      and the shortage policy, with staged release by supervisor approval (design §13);
    - `batch#ProductionAction`, a result per run;
    - `get#ProductionOperations`, with readiness and its reason.
  - The seeded `WeApproved` → `WeInPlanning` transition with its unrelease guard (Warehouse P16a left it, impl-warehouse
    §4), `WeApproved` → `WeOnHold`, and `WeOnHold` → `WeApproved` so a hold before start resumes as released rather
    than started (F9). The framework accepts every flow's transitions on any WorkEffort, so the guard
    is the only path.
  - **Screens:**
    - WorkOrders: Find, the list, Selection, `view-board` by status or facility whose move calls
      `transition#ProductionOrder`, `view-calendar` over the estimated dates, and the saved finds Ready, Late, Blocked,
      Mine and By product;
    - NewWorkOrder: Identity, Method and Review, with the producible-now column from `get#BomExplosion`'s buildable
      quantity at the run's facility, over `get#AvailableInventory` (R-MFG-30; F24). Its requirements stop at
      non-phantom sub-assemblies, so their stock counts, and phantoms are blown through (§4, Q8);
    - WorkOrderDetail: Header, the Lifecycle dialog with its impact preview, Overview, Operations (no Reschedule until
      P12) and Notes and files;
    - Product360's Open runs link.
  - **Outputs:** the production traveler and pick sheet (design §11), with the run's revision, operation sequence,
    material and lot needs and a QR identity from Products P11; the release notice.
  - **Shell:** the run palette type; quick create draft work order.
- **P5b, materials and stock.**
  - `get#ProductionMaterials`, and `store#ProductionMaterial` for manual draft lines under `PRODUCTION_PLAN`.
  - Components: the list and AddMaterial. Stage opens Warehouse's Move with the run fixed; there is no WIP location
    (R-MFG-03). Substitute is P9.
  - MaterialIssueReceipt: Warehouse's `Shared/MaterialIssueReceipt` with the Manufacturing row of crosscut §3.9, over
    P16b's guards: issue, return unused, receive output and preview backflush. Backflush follows the policy and issues
    the run lines' exact quantities from chosen lots, or none. A held asset or a shortfall is refused, even at a facility
    that allows issue beyond quantity on hand (F12).
  - InventoryAvailability: Products' `Shared/InventoryAvailability` with the Manufacturing row of crosscut §3.7, at
    `Manufacturing/Planning/InventoryAvailability`; held quantity by status, apart (R-MFG-24).
  - The shortage notice and Home's shortage queue.
- **Usable when** (design §10.3, cancellation and retry):
  - a planner creates a draft run for DEMO_1_1 from the released BOM and releases it, and the run keeps the policy
    of its release time after P4's policy changes;
  - a second run with a short component is refused release until a supervisor approves a staged release, and the
    short line's issue stays blocked;
  - a board move to Released runs the same guard, and a bulk release of three runs names the blocked one;
  - a released run is held before start and resumes as released; an unrelease after an issue is refused; an unposted
    draft is cancelled;
  - two components are issued at two operations through the Manufacturing mount, an operator without `STOCK_ISSUE`
    for the facility is refused, and a backflush preview shows its lots and issues once.

### P6 — Cost evidence

M8's evidence, before the phases whose facts write it (design §3 ProductionCosts; crosscut §4.1 CX-COST; review §4.1
steps 19 and 20).

- **Records:** `mantle.work.production.ProductionCostEvent` (unique by source, component and revision) and
  `ProductionCostAllocation`; the cost-review status, an audit-logged field of the run.
- **`mantle.work.ProductionServices`:**
  - `record#ProductionCostEvent`, internal, called inside the transaction that causes the fact. Here its callers are
    P16b's issue, return-unused and output guards, and the material part of `receive#SubcontractOutput`. Each material
    event references the hook's transaction and posts nothing again. An output or return receipt without
    `acquireCost` would post nothing (F13), so the guard refuses it. Later phases add loss (P7), labor and machine
    (P10), and outside processing (P14);
  - `get#ProductionCosts`, and `review#ProductionCosts` under `PRODUCTION_COST_REVIEW`, which sets the review status
    and notifies Accounting on the `ProductionCostReview` NotificationTopic, seeded in mr-mantle's data. Accounting
    Home and the queue that read it are P15's.
- **Screens:** ProductionCosts: Costs and CloseReview. The frozen estimate shows with `PRODUCT_COST_VIEW`, actual
  values and ledger links with `ACCOUNTING_VIEW`.
- **Usable when:**
  - two issues, a return of one unused component and an output receipt each write one event linked to the hook's
    transaction, and a retried issue writes none;
  - a cost estimator sees the frozen estimate and no actuals, and a financial reader sees both;
  - a review request notifies Accounting with the run and source revision.

### P7 — Quantities, by-products and loss

Design §3 Quantities and ByProducts, §6 ScrapLoss and §12.2; M2, M4, M6 and M8.

- **Records:** `ProductionQuantityEvent` and `mantle.work.production.ProductionLoss`.
- **`mantle.work.ProductionServices`:**
  - `get#ProductionQuantities` and `store#ProductionOutput` (draft outputs and by-products);
  - `record#ProductionQuantity`: good, pending, process loss, scrap and rework, in one orchestration with the output
    receipt when they are coupled;
  - `change#ProductionQuantity`: a target delta that rewrites the WeptConsume and WeptProduce rows and cannot go below
    the facts;
  - `record#ProductionLoss` by its three paths (R-MFG-20): issued components (a scrap cost event, no stock), received or
    held output of an open run (the asset issued back to the run), and process loss (a quantity only). Free stock is
    scrapped in Warehouse;
  - `find#ProductionLosses`;
  - complete in `transition#ProductionOrder`: the reconciliation of §12.2, the settled operations and material
    disposition. Where ProductionPolicy's flag allows it (§4), the final output receipt reconciles and completes in
    the same service. Partial completion offers Finish remainder with approved loss; Backorder is P9's;
  - `record#ProductionQuantity` and `record#ProductionLoss` check `PRODUCTION_OPERATE`, `change#ProductionQuantity`
    `PRODUCTION_PLAN`, and complete `PRODUCTION_SUPERVISE`;
  - `receive#ProductionOutput` admits output beyond the target within the overproduction tolerance, and above it with
    a supervisor's approval, which Warehouse P16b refuses today (OVER_RECEIPT; impl-warehouse §5). A by-product stays
    refused until P15's allocation (BYPRODUCT_NOT_COSTED).
- **Screens:** Quantities (OutputPlan, AddOutput, Reconcile, ChangeQuantity), ByProducts (with AllocationReview's
  estimate; its actual allocation is P15's), and ScrapLoss (Find, Losses, RecordLoss).
- **Approvals:** exceptional loss and overproduction above the policy, by `PRODUCTION_SUPERVISE`.
- **Outputs:** finished, secondary and WIP labels on Products P11's label contract; no label claims acceptance before
  disposition.
- **Usable when** (design §10.3, partial production):
  - a run for 10 receives 6 good, records 1 process loss and the scrap of an issued component (a cost event and no stock
    movement), and shows 3 remaining;
  - scrapping a received output asset of the open run issues it back to the run, not to shrinkage;
  - a target cut below the good quantity is refused, and a cut to 9 writes a delta;
  - overproduction above the tolerance waits for a supervisor;
  - complete is refused until the quantities reconcile, then succeeds; a retry posts nothing twice.

### P8 — Quality

Design §3 QualityGates and §6 Inspections, QualityInspection and InspectionTemplates; M6's inspection part, over
Warehouse P8's CX-QUALITY and its `QUALITY_*` permissions, which P1 grants to the quality groups.

- **Gates:** `get#SourceInspectionStatus` answers for the run, operation and output-line sources; the start and
  complete guards and dependent operations read it. Each released operation keeps its template as of its release time.
- **Templates:** in-process and final applicability, the sampling basis, and the method or operation they attach to.
- **Held output:** P16b receives it AstQuarantine and creates the inspection in the same operation.
  `dispose#Inspection` releases it, reserving it first to a pegged order item (R-SA-10); a scrap disposition of an open
  run's output takes P7's loss path.
- **Screens:** QualityGates; Inspections in the production context; QualityInspection and InspectionTemplates
  (Warehouse's shared screens) with the Manufacturing context, the operator mode with sequential controls and the scan
  field.
- **Outputs:** the quality checklist and the quality certificate; the quality-block notice.
- **Usable when** (design §10.3, quality hold):
  - output of a run whose final template applies is received held, and complete is refused while it is pending;
  - an inspector records and submits, cannot verify, and a verifier verifies;
  - a disposition releases five units and scraps one through the loss path; held quantity never counts as good;
  - an in-process failure blocks the dependent operation's start, naming the inspection;
  - a template revision leaves the released run's gate as it was.

### P9 — Controlled changes

Design §3 Components' Substitute, SplitWorkOrder, Disassembly and WorkOrderDetail's cancellation and clone, §5
BillOfMaterialsCompare's amendment action; M4.

- **`mantle.work.ProductionServices`:**
  - `substitute#ProductionMaterial`: a candidate from the BOM item's substitution rule (Products' PatEquivalent rows
    only when the rule allows), with supervisor approval (`PRODUCTION_SUPERVISE`). It adds a WeptConsume row and
    reduces the original's; after release it is an amendment;
  - `amend#ProductionOrder` (design §12.1): an audit-logged change that remaps only unexecuted lines and operations and
    keeps the original facts' links, under the amendment policy (§4), checking `METHOD_APPROVE` and
    `PRODUCTION_SUPERVISE`;
  - `preview#ProductionSplit` and `split#ProductionOrder` (`PRODUCTION_PLAN`), split and backorder, conserving
    remaining demand;
  - cancellation after postings as a reviewed reversal or residual plan; clone through `create#ProductionOrder`;
  - `reverse#SupportedAssembly` over `breakDown#Assembly`, for a PtPickAssembly kit only. The kit receipt's reduction is
    a dated reversing delta in an open period, not `repost#Asset`'s unpost and re-post (§4; F15). Both reposts change
    Mantle, so each sits behind its flag (impl-accounting §4): Disassembly needs Accounting P2a's issuance flag and
    this receipt flag on, and is refused naming the flag otherwise. `breakDown#Assembly` unissues by the kit's
    current PatMfgBom quantities, so the guard checks them against the quantities actually issued and refuses a
    difference.
- **Screens:** Components' Substitute; SplitWorkOrder (Allocation, Disposition, Confirm); Disassembly (Assembly,
  Preview, Confirm); BillOfMaterialsCompare's Request amendment.
- **Approvals:** substitution and amendment.
- **Usable when** (design §10.3, released method change):
  - an approved substitute is issued, the original's demand drops, and an arbitrary product is refused;
  - after the first operation, an amendment to a later BOM release remaps the remaining operations only, and the issued
    facts keep their lines;
  - a split moves 4 of 10 remaining to a backorder on the same method revision, and a retry answers the same IDs;
  - a DEMO_PA kit assembly is reversed with dated reversing entries in an open period, and a kit unit already sold is
    refused.

### P10 — Shop floor and time

Design §4 ShopFloor, OperationExecution and Instructions, §3 ProductionTime; M7, and review §4.1 steps 17 and 18.

- **Records and seeds:** `MachineRuntimeEvent`, the instruction step acknowledgment, and the WorkType seeds
  `WktpProductionSetup`, `WktpProductionRun` and `WktpProductionRework` (F18).
- **`mantle.work.ProductionServices`:**
  - `get#ShopFloorQueue`, `get#ProductionOperation`, `get#ProductionInstructions` and `record#InstructionStep`;
  - `complete#ProductionOperation`: the operation event and any coupled material and output posting atomically, and
    `TimeEntry.pieceCount` under the piece-rate policy (R-MFG-28);
  - `record#MachineRuntime`, whose closed interval writes the machine cost event at the effective WorkCenterRate. With
    no effective rate it is recorded unvalued and listed for review, and P15's close refuses the run until it is
    valued (§4);
  - `complete#ProductionOperation`, `record#MachineRuntime` and `record#InstructionStep` check `PRODUCTION_OPERATE`.
- **Projects' side** (§4), in mr-mantle's `mantle.work.TimesheetServices`, calling no ironstone service:
  - the production approver rule in `get#TimesheetApprovers`: the run's supervisor or the person's line manager
    (R-MFG-22). Its project rule already takes an item's root, or the item itself, as the project, so the operations
    carry the run as their root and the supervisor's assignment counts as a manager's (F17);
  - the hook on `approve#Timesheet`, calling `record#ProductionCostEvent`: a labor event per entry under a
    WepProductionRun, at the class and work-type costing rate (`RateAmount` by `emplPositionClassId` and
    `workTypeEnumId`), its `rateAmountId` as the rate identity; an entry with none is unvalued and blocks cost close
    (design Y2). Reopening writes a reversal, and a rate change after approval a delta, caught on the TimeEntry in
    Mantle, not in BOSS's rate form (F23; R-SA-09).
- **Screens:**
  - ShopFloor: the `.qvue` manager board and operator card (Station, Queue, Actions) with its `tui` twin;
  - OperationExecution (Work, PersonTimer, MachineRuntime, CompleteStep) and Instructions (Steps, Evidence), at
    `density="handheld"` with `scan-input`;
  - ProductionTime: the Projects time surface filtered to the run and its operations.
- **Checks:** start checks the predecessors, the operator's authorization and skills (blocking when the template requires them, advisory otherwise; §4), equipment
  restrictions and the configured material and inspection gates.
- **Shell and outputs:** Today's assigned due operations; the operator instructions print.
- **Usable when** (design §4):
  - an operator at phone width scans an operation, starts it with the person timer (switching from another timer with
    a confirmation), acknowledges a required instruction step, records machine runtime apart from labor, and completes
    5 good and 1 scrap with the coupled output receipt;
  - completion before a predecessor is refused, naming it, and keeps what was entered; a timed-out retry answers the
    first result;
  - the run's supervisor approves the operator's timesheet, which writes the labor event; reopening it writes the
    reversal;
  - the same flow completes in the terminal twin.

### P11 — Downtime and maintenance

Design §6 Downtime, Equipment, RequestDetail and WorkItemDetail; M6's downtime part; D24.

- **Records and seeds:** `mantle.work.production.ProductionDowntime`, with its correction chain; the request type
  `RqtMaintenance` and the maintenance type `MntTpCorrective` (F18).
- **Maintenance's outage fact** (design Y3), its contract under its names: a minimal `ResourceUnavailability` (the
  asset, kind actual, from and thru, the source downtime) and
  `mantle.work.ResourceBookingServices.record#ResourceUnavailability`, which Maintenance MT-07 later extends with
  bookings, `end#ResourceUnavailability` and corrections.
- **`mantle.work.ProductionServices`:** `store#ProductionDowntime` (open, close, correct), `find#ProductionDowntime`,
  and `request#ProductionMaintenance`: an AssetMaintenance through
  `mantle.product.EquipmentServices.create#AssetMaintenance`, and when wanted a Request linked to the downtime and the
  asset through `mantle.request.RequestServices.link#RequestRecord`, not Commons' same-named service. Recording checks
  `PRODUCTION_OPERATE`, and a correction `PRODUCTION_SUPERVISE`. An equipment-fault downtime on an asset creates one
  ResourceUnavailability, or links the open one for that asset, in the same transaction.
- **Screens:** Downtime (the list, ReportStop, Maintenance); OperationExecution's Pause opens it; EquipmentDetail's
  Request maintenance action and downtime (design §14's missing pane; §4); RequestDetail and WorkItemDetail, Projects'
  shared screens, with the Manufacturing context.
- **Shell:** quick create downtime report.
- **Usable when:**
  - an operator reports an equipment fault on a line with a maintenance request, which makes an AssetMaintenance and a
    linked Request;
  - the fault records one outage for the asset, and a second fault on it links the same outage;
  - closing the downtime leaves the request, maintenance and outage open and starts no timer;
  - a no-material stop suggests no maintenance;
  - a supervisor's correction keeps the original interval and actor.

### P12 — Scheduling and capacity

Design §7 ProductionSchedule and Capacity, §3 Operations' Reschedule; M5, the scheduling part of M10, and M11.

- **`mantle.work.ProductionPlanningServices`:** `get#ProductionSchedule`; `schedule#ProductionOperation`
  (`PRODUCTION_SCHEDULE`), a preview, then a commit that rechecks calendar, skills and equipment, capacity,
  predecessors, quantity and version, with a conflict override only by `PRODUCTION_SUPERVISE`; and
  `get#WorkCenterLoad` completed with the calendar, downtime and bookings.
- **M11:** the Projects WorkItems Timeline component extended with resource lanes, offline shading and a preview-only
  drag, whose commit is the Move form (F4). Projects' own Timeline keeps its behavior and specs.
- **Screens:** ProductionSchedule, the `.qvue` timeline with its `tui` twin (Preview, Apply, Unschedule, Show
  conflicts); Capacity (Parameters, Load); Operations' Reschedule; FacilityDetail's offline change with its preview.
- **Approvals and outputs:** the schedule override topic; the schedule-change notice; the plan snapshot print and CSV.
- **Usable when:**
  - a scheduler drags an operation to the second line, sees the conflict in the preview, and commits through the Move
    form;
  - an override needs a supervisor and changes no capacity;
  - an offline interval on a line previews the operations it moves;
  - Capacity shows nominal, calendar-adjusted, downtime, booked and available hours, and names missing data;
  - the terminal twin makes the same move.

### P13 — Supply planning

Crosscut CX-PLANNING and §3.20, with design §7 SupplyPlanning (§4). These are a shared contract: crosscut's record
and service names, and `Shared/SupplyPlanning`, which Purchasing mounts when it is built and Warehouse from its §7.

- **Records:** `mantle.request.requirement.PlanningRun`, `PlanningSuggestion` and `RequirementSupply`. A
  requirement's organization (R-SA-15) is a RequirementParty in the OrgInternal role, not a new field
  (impl-drawers-commons §4); `Requirement.quantityUomId` (crosscut §3.20).
- **`mantle.product.SupplyPlanningServices`:**
  - `run#SupplyPlan`, under `SUPPLY_PLAN_RUN`: one current run per organization and facility set; it nets
    `get#InventoryProjectedInfo`, drafts' WeptConsume and WeptProduce rows included, by the run's line and its parent
    warehouse, with kit assemblies told apart from production (F16); it explodes make demand through
    `get#BomExplosion`'s requirements and nets level by level (§4, Q8; F24): a non-phantom sub-assembly nets against
    its own stock and supply before its shortage is exploded, and a phantom is blown through; it dates releases from
    the version's lead and preparation days (R-MFG-31), shows held receipts and output as a pending-release line with
    the inspection's due date, left out of netting (§4), and calls `check#ProductUsable`;
  - `get#SupplyPlan`, and `store#PlanSchedule` under `SUPPLY_PLAN_RUN`, the one schedule. The schedule carries the
    organization's option to net held quantity whose inspection is due within the lead time (§4); off by default;
  - `convert#PlanningSuggestions`: make through `create#ProductionOrder`, under `PRODUCTION_PLAN`, with the method as
    of the plan date, the RequirementSupply link and WorkRequirementFulfillment `WrfDelivers`, under lock and
    operation identity, a result per group. P14 adds the outside-processing buy conversion; ordinary buy and transfer
    suggestions are shown with their links, and their conversion waits for Purchasing and Warehouse (§7).
- **Screens:** `Shared/SupplyPlanning` (PlanParameters, PlanSuggestions, DemandSupply, PlanSchedule,
  ConvertSuggestions) with the Manufacturing row of crosscut §3.20, at `Manufacturing/Planning/SupplyPlanning`. Home's
  shortages open it with the same organization, plant and date.
- **Usable when** (design §10.3, shortage to finished stock):
  - a sales demand for DEMO_1_1 yields a make suggestion and a buy suggestion for its component;
  - converting the make suggestion creates a draft run with its RequirementSupply and lines, and a second conversion
    of the same demand answers the existing run;
  - a stale run is refused conversion until recalculated, and an obsolete product is an exception.

### P14 — Subcontracting

Design §7 SubcontractOperations, SubcontractDetail, Supplier360, OrderDetail and ShipmentDetail; crosscut
CX-SUBCONTRACT; review §4.1 steps 26–31.

- **Records:** `ProductionSubcontract`.
- **`mantle.work.ProductionServices`:** `request#SubcontractService` (`PRODUCTION_PLAN`; an `RqTpProduct` Requirement
  for the service product, with a RequirementSupply demand link to the operation), `store#ProductionSubcontract`,
  `get#SubcontractMaterials`, `get#SubcontractStatus` and `find#SubcontractOperations`. P16b's
  `receive#SubcontractOutput` gains the outside-processing accrual event at service acceptance; the bill match writes
  the price-variance event through Accounting's match, `mantle.account.InvoiceMatchServices.evaluate#InvoiceMatch`.
- **Accounting's contract** (PUR-MATCH): `evaluate#InvoiceMatch` reads ServiceAcceptance under the match policy's
  service-acceptance rule, so a service line matches against its accepted quantity (Accounting P7 left it;
  impl-accounting §7). Purchasing P6 checks it is there.
- **The outside-processing buy conversion** (§4), in P13's `convert#PlanningSuggestions`, to design-purchasing's
  Subcontracting and SupplyPlanning rules (R-PUR-22): a draft PO per supplier group, with the service OrderItem at the
  requirement's quantity and unit and the supplier price from Products' resolver, its `OrderItemWorkEffort` to the
  operation (`requiredWork` Y), and a RequirementSupply row. Conversion never places or approves the PO; that stays
  Purchasing's, and until Purchasing is built the walk's demo service places it.
  - The conversion checks `PURCHASE_ORDER_EDIT` (Warehouse P7 seeded it). P14 seeds `SUPPLIER_PROFILE_EDIT` in
    mr-mantle; `PAYABLE_IMPORT` and `RETURN_AUTHORIZE` exist. BossSetupData grants `PURCHASE_ORDER_EDIT` to
    `BOSS_PURCHASING_BUYER`, seeded here without Purchasing's launcher, as Products P1 seeded the other apps' groups,
    with three of the group's other permissions (`PAYABLE_IMPORT`, `SUPPLIER_PROFILE_EDIT` and `RETURN_AUTHORIZE`),
    and all four to `BOSS_PURCHASING_ADMIN`; Purchasing P1 adds `SUPPLIER_SCORECARD_EDIT`. The action shows on the
    Manufacturing mount to a holder of that group, which crosscut §3.20's Manufacturing row gains.
- **Screens:**
  - SubcontractOperations and SubcontractDetail (Agreement, Materials, Acceptance);
  - Supplier360: Products' screen with the Manufacturing row of crosscut §3.3, its subcontract orders filtered (design
    §14's pane; §4);
  - OrderDetail: Projects' screen with the Manufacturing row of crosscut §3.6, its items showing production and
    subcontract links;
  - ShipmentDetail: Accounting's screen with the Manufacturing row of crosscut §3.8, read only.
- **Outputs:** the dispatch and return instructions.
- **Usable when** (Warehouse's subcontract walk, from the Manufacturing side):
  - a planner requests outside processing for an operation, and a buyer's conversion on the Manufacturing mount makes a
    draft service PO line with OrderItemWorkEffort and RequirementSupply; the planner cannot convert it, and a second
    conversion answers the same line;
  - components dispatched to the vendor-custody facility stay the organization's;
  - the output receipt issues the components, holds the output, accepts the service line once and writes the accrual
    event once; the supplier's bill matches against the accepted quantity and writes the price variance;
  - a run reader without the buyer grant sees no PO price.

### P15 — Cost close

Accounting's contracts (§4), built to design-accounting ProductionCostClose and AC-07 and crosscut §3.24; review §4.1
steps 20–23.

- **Records:** `mantle.work.production.ProductionAllocationPolicy`, effective-dated rows with their key fields
  audit-logged; a cost close keeps the row it applied.
- **`mantle.ledger.ProductionCostServices`** (new), each checking its permission and the organization:
  - `store#AllocationPolicy` (`ACCOUNTING_ADMIN`): the overhead basis and the co-product method, defaulting to
    work-center hours and normalized quantity (§4);
  - `preview#CostClose` (`ACCOUNTING_GL_POST`): the absorption of the events not yet in the GL (Dr WIP; Cr applied
    labor, applied machine and overhead, and the outside-processing accrual), overhead from the policy, the co-product
    reallocation, and the residual WIP to variance. It blocks while an entry on the run is on an unapproved timesheet,
    and needs an open period;
  - `post#CostClose` (`PRODUCTION_COST_POST`, which Accounting seeded and granted to `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_APPROVE` and
    `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_ADMIN`): one run-level transaction that calls `transition#ProductionOrder` (Close). After
    close a late event is an adjustment, which `preview#CostClose` picks up in adjustment mode (R-SA-11).
- **`ironstone.accounting.ProductionCostServices.find#CostCloseQueue`**, BOSS's read for the queue: the runs P6's
  review request queued.
- **By-product receipt:** `receive#ProductionOutput` takes a by-product at its co-product allocation, which Warehouse
  P16b refuses today (BYPRODUCT_NOT_COSTED).
- **Screens:** `Shared/ProductionCostClose`, mounted at `Accounting/Inventory/ProductionCostClose` and
  `Manufacturing/WorkOrders/WorkOrderDetail/ProductionCostClose`, the second needing the finance groups and not the
  Accounting launcher;
  CostingPolicies at `Accounting/Settings/CostingPolicies`; ByProducts' actual allocation; the queue on Accounting Home
  and CloseChecks, which read P6's ProductionCostReview topic.
- **Usable when** (design-accounting §16.3 production-to-GL, the cost close):
  - a by-product is received as its own stock at its allocated cost;
  - a completed run with material, labor, machine and outside-processing events previews its absorption, co-product
    split and variance, and posts once, closing the run in the same transaction;
  - a retry answers the first post, and a closed period is refused;
  - a labor event after close is previewed as an adjustment;
  - a cost estimator can request review but not preview or post.

### P16 — Reports

Design §9; the reporting part of M10.

- **`mantle.work.ProductionReportServices`:** the eight report services of design §9, and `get#ProductionDashboard`.
  Each checks `PRODUCTION_VIEW` and returns its scope, as-of time, units and currency, and the partitions it could not
  read; money columns need `ACCOUNTING_VIEW`. OEE is availability × performance × quality, with downtime unioned and
  reworked units counted once, and "Not calculable" where data is missing.
- **Screens:** Reports, and WorkOrderStatusReport, MaterialReport, OperationPerformanceReport, LossReport,
  QualityReport, ProductionCostReport, BillOfMaterialsVarianceReport and PlanningReport (over P13's runs). Home
  complete, its Kpis as dashboard widget providers (crosscut §3.17) opening their reports with the same filters.
- **Exports:** each report as CSV with its screen's filters and columns.
- **Usable when:**
  - OEE for a line shows its three factors from P10's events and P11's downtime;
  - a reader without financial read gets the quantities and no money columns, on screen and in the export;
  - a failed partition is named and the total marked incomplete, never zero.

### P17 — Finish

- The terminal twins, and the server-static pass.
- The design §10.3 acceptance review and crosscut §6 standalone operation. A Manufacturing user with no other launcher
  plans, makes and receives through the shared mounts. That user is refused cost, finance, other organizations' runs and
  stock actions without `STOCK_ISSUE`, through URLs, shared contexts, the shop floor, exports, the palette and
  search.
- The §11 outputs not built earlier.
- The inventories' **Implemented in** columns, the design's Impl column, and Remaining-Work.

## 4. Decisions

These are made before and during the build. Each one that changes the design is also written into
design-manufacturing.md, or into the owner's design.

Decided in the other apps' plans, and binding here:

| Date | Decision | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Products builds Manufacturing's methods (M3), effective-dated as below, `WorkCenter`, `WorkCenterRate` and `get#OperationCostBasis`, with the five shared method screens in the Products context (impl-products P8). Capacity, alternates and load, and Manufacturing's own method screens, stay Manufacturing's | The user's call, in impl-products §4 |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Accounting builds ProductionCostClose and CostingPolicies with Manufacturing's cost events, output receipt and run close. Its P13 seeds the production GL account types and the scrap account, and its P19 readiness checks the WIP and transfer accounts | The user's call, in impl-accounting §4. Here: P15 |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Warehouse builds crosscut CX-QUALITY (its P8), and Manufacturing's runs and their lines (`create#ProductionOrder`, `release#ProductionOrder` and `ProductionRunLine`) and stock guards with the CX-PRODUCTION fields (its P16). The rest of M4 and M2, and Manufacturing's screens, stay Manufacturing's | The user's call, in impl-warehouse §4 |
| Oct 28, 2026 | The shared screens an app builds first carry its context only; another app's context is added when that app is built | As in each plan |

Made for this plan:

| Date | Decision | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Manufacturing is built after Products, Accounting and Warehouse, and before Purchasing. It extends what those three built for it, and Purchasing later adds its context and conversions to what Manufacturing builds: SupplyPlanning and the outside-processing PO lines | The user's call. The three plans assume the first; [impl-purchasing.md](impl-purchasing.md) now follows it |
| Oct 28, 2026 | The shared rules of impl-drawers-commons §4 apply: parties by role, and changes by effective date and the audit log. Here: ProductionPolicy, the reason codes and ProductionAllocationPolicy are effective-dated rows with audit-logged key fields, and a requirement's organization is a RequirementParty role. The methods and runs follow it too, as decided below | The user's call, in the Purchasing plan review (impl-purchasing §4) |
| Oct 28, 2026 | The root: `BOSS_MANUFACTURING` as root user group and artifact group. Its groups take `MANTLE_USER_ORG`, and `BOSS_MANUFACTURING_ADMIN`, with all authz on the root, `MANTLE_ACTIVE_ORG` and `MANTLE_PRIVATE_CONTACT` (impl-drawers-commons §4). Products P1's work-center group is `BOSS_MANUFACTURING_RESOURCE_ADMIN` (renamed), the design's production and resource administrator (F2) | The user's call (§5 review), for every BOSS root |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Plant scope is Warehouse's facility scope: `MANTLE_USER_ORG`'s Facility filter, `ownerPartyId` in `filterOrgIds`, for production facilities too; the admin group works in every plant | Follows from the root decision and impl-warehouse §4 |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Methods and runs under the shared rule (impl-products §4, impl-warehouse §4): a `ProductBom` header with effective-dated `ProductBomItem` lines of stable ID; routings on Mantle's WepRouting templates with dated `WeatRoutingComp` rows; a release is a decision that stamps the lines' dates. A run has its own `ProductionRunLine` rows from create, frozen at release, with its revision, release time and frozen standard as audit-logged run fields; an amendment is an audit-logged change to its remaining lines. In this plan a method "version" is the method as of a release date, and a run's "snapshot" is its lines and release time. M3's version and M4's snapshot records are dropped | The user's call (§5 review), in impl-products §4. It answers the draft-lines check (P0) too |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Production instructions under the shared rule (P2): a published instruction is a `WorkEffortContent` row of an instruction content type on the operation template, its file stored immutably with a checksum. `WorkEffortContent` gains audit-logged `fromDate` and `thruDate`, so a publish ends the previous row and starts the next. The required evidence and the quality template are audit-logged fields of the operation template, and a run's operation shows the instruction as of its release time. An operator's acknowledgment stays a record of its own (who, when, which content row). `ProductionInstructionVersion` is dropped | The user's call (§5 review), raised by the shared rule. The alternative was the designed version record as an exception |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Completion with no formal inspection (P7): explicit final reconciliation by default. A ProductionPolicy flag, off by default, lets the final output receipt reconcile and complete in the same atomic service with the same evidence | The user's call (§5 review): design §14's recommendation, with its opt-in built now. The alternatives were the opt-in later, and auto-completion |
| Oct 28, 2026 | The released-run amendment policy (P9) as design §14 recommends: no method change after any material, time or output fact by default; a controlled amendment of the remaining lines and operations, reviewed by the method approver and the production supervisor, linked to a change notice when Products ChangeNotices is on; and a ProductionPolicy flag for strict release that refuses amendments and needs a linked new run | The user's call (§5 review). The alternatives were never amending, and amending only until the first fact |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Kit disassembly ships in P9 (F15). P9 makes the kit receipt's reduction a dated reversing delta in an open period, as Accounting P2a does for issuances, in place of `repost#Asset`'s unpost, delete and re-post; the guard checks the quantities actually issued and refuses a difference. General manufacturing unbuild stays §7 | The user's call (§5 review). The alternatives were enabling it only if P0 found both reposts already safe, and §7 |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Skill certification and safety acknowledgment (P10) as design §14 recommends: an operation template's required skills (`WorkEffortSkillStandard` against `PartySkill`) or required acknowledgment block Start, with a supervisor override and its reason recorded; with none configured the check is a visible advisory | The user's call (§5 review). The alternatives were always advisory, and always blocking |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Machine runtime with no effective WorkCenterRate (P10) is recorded with its hours and no value, marked unvalued, and listed in the cost exceptions and P15's queue. A review writes its cost event once a rate is effective on its date, and P15 refuses to close a run that still has one | The user's call (§5 review), as Accounting splits guard failures by source (impl-accounting §4). The alternative was refusing the entry |
| Oct 28, 2026 | The three panes design §14 found missing are built, each in its phase with the Manufacturing context and written into crosscut (the Oct 28 design sweep): EquipmentDetail's Request maintenance (P11), Supplier360's subcontract orders (P14), and OrderDetail's production links, a sales order's supplying runs (P5) and a service PO's run and operation (P14) | The user's call (§5 review) |
| Oct 28, 2026 | The default allocation (P15): overhead at a rate per work-center hour, from WorkCenterRate's overhead component, times the run's actual setup and run hours; co-products by quantity normalized to a common unit. CostingPolicies also offers fixed shares on the BOM's output lines and relative sales value for co-products, and a percentage of direct labor or none for overhead | The user's call (§5 review): the review's recommendation, with the alternatives selectable. It is in crosscut §8 and design-accounting since the Oct 28 design sweep. The alternatives were the defaults alone, and relative sales value by default |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Held quantity in planning (design §14, crosscut §9): a pending-release line with the inspection's due date, left out of netting by default; the plan schedule's organization option nets held quantity whose inspection is due within the lead time (P13) | The user's call, in the Purchasing plan review (impl-purchasing §4, answer 12); the design's recommendation |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Phase order: methods, work centers and the production policy first; then the runs and their materials; cost evidence early, so each later fact writes its event as it is built; then quantities and quality, controlled changes, the shop floor and downtime, scheduling, supply planning, subcontracting, the cost close and reports | The user's call. The alternative was the run first (P5 before P2–P4), on Products P8's methods and a default policy |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Manufacturing builds crosscut CX-PLANNING (P13): PlanningRun, PlanningSuggestion and RequirementSupply, `run#SupplyPlan`, `get#SupplyPlan`, `store#PlanSchedule` and `convert#PlanningSuggestions`, and `Shared/SupplyPlanning` with the Manufacturing context. It converts make suggestions (P13) and outside-processing requirements to draft service PO lines (P14), the second for `BOSS_PURCHASING_BUYER` on the Manufacturing mount, which crosscut §3.20's Manufacturing row gains; the Mantle service checks `PURCHASE_ORDER_EDIT`, which that group holds (the plan review Q2 row below). Purchasing adds its mount and buy conversion when it is built, and Warehouse its mount and transfer conversion from its §7 | The user's call. The alternative was to wait for Purchasing, with SupplyPlanning, make conversion and the service PO conversion in §7. Warehouse had left CX-PLANNING for its owner (impl-warehouse §4) |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Mantle stands without BOSS, and business logic leans to Mantle. No Mantle service, SECA, EECA, script, data file or spec here calls `ironstone.*`, reads a BOSS screen, entity or setting, or names a BOSS group; each checks its Moqui permission and the organization itself, and a BOSS screen calls it after `ironstone.manufacturing.AccessServices`, with no pass-through. Moved: Accounting's cost close core to `mantle.ledger.ProductionCostServices` (`store#AllocationPolicy`, `preview#CostClose`, `post#CostClose`), with only `find#CostCloseQueue` left in `ironstone.accounting`; the ProductionCostReview topic to mr-mantle's data. `mantle.work`'s production, planning and report services and the timesheet hook, `mantle.product`'s methods and supply planning, and `mantle.request`'s requirement records stay Mantle, checking permissions in place of BOSS groups; record links route through Commons' `get#RecordLink`. P1 seeds the other five `PRODUCTION_*` permissions (Warehouse P16a seeded `PRODUCTION_VIEW` and `PRODUCTION_PLAN`) and `SUPPLY_PLAN_RUN`, and grants the seven, with `METHOD_VIEW` and the `QUALITY_*` permissions, to the Manufacturing groups; P14 seeds `SUPPLIER_PROFILE_EDIT` and grants `BOSS_PURCHASING_BUYER` four, and Purchasing P1 adds `SUPPLIER_SCORECARD_EDIT` | The user's call (plan review Q2): both rules are in impl-drawers-commons §4. The owner designs' names follow in the design sweep |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Explosion depth (P5, P13): the tree shows every level, but requirements and buildable quantity stop at a non-phantom sub-assembly, so its stock counts, and a phantom is blown through with its routing. P5's producible-now reads `get#BomExplosion`'s buildable quantity at the run's facility; P13 nets level by level, a sub-assembly's stock and supply before its own shortage is exploded. `fullBlowThrough` keeps the full depth for a caller that wants it; neither phase passes it | The user's call (plan review Q8), as Odoo does. Products P9 built it (F24) |

## 6. Findings

Design assumptions found wrong or unstated in the code, with the resolution. Where a resolution changes the design, it
is written there too.

| # | Finding | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| F1 | P0: `screen/Manufacturing/` has six placeholders: Home, WorkOrders, ShopFloor, BillsOfMaterials, Planning and Settings. There are no Routings, WorkCenters, Quality, Subcontracting, Approvals or Reports areas; the root mounts only Chatter and RecordFiles and has no `<shell-providers>`. The `BOSS_MANUFACTURING` artifact group has only the admin authz (`BOSS_MANUFACTURING_ADMIN` for ADMIN, `BOSS_MANUFACTURING_APPADMIN` for the admin group) | P1 adds the root user group and its `MANTLE_USER_ORG` authz |
| F2 | P0: Products P1 seeds `BOSS_MANUFACTURING_READ` as "Method reader" and `BOSS_MANUFACTURING_RESOURCE_ADMIN` as "Work-center administrator", beside `_METHOD`, `_METHOD_APPROVE` and `BOSS_MANUFACTURING_ADMIN` ("Manufacturing administrator"), and Products P9 seeds `_COST`. The design's are production reader and production/resource administrator, and eight more are unseeded | P1 corrects the two descriptions and seeds the eight |
| F3 | P0: neither `MANTLE_USER_ORG` nor `MANTLE_ACTIVE_ORG` filters WorkEffort, WorkEffortProduct, Asset or AssetIssuance; Facility's filter is in `MANTLE_USER_ORG` only (impl-warehouse F2) | Production rows through services (§2); plant scope through Warehouse's facility filter (P1) |
| F4 | P0: the Projects WorkItems `Timeline.qvue` lanes are sprints and milestones; a drag commits the move at once (`moveBar`); there are no resource lanes or offline shading | P12 extends it with a preview-only resource mode (M11), leaving Projects' behavior as it is |
| F5 | P0: the form XSD has `view-board`, `view-calendar` and `view-tree`, and the screen XSD `dashboard` and `number-card` (R-MFG-12) | WorkOrders' board and calendar (P5); the explosion and where-used trees; Home's Kpis (P16) |
| F6 | P0: BOSS has no `Shared/ProductionCostClose` or `Shared/SupplyPlanning`; impl-accounting §7 and impl-warehouse §7 each leave theirs for later | P15 builds the first, and P13 the second (§4) |
| F7 | P0: `create#ProductionRun` sets WetEvent, WepProductionRun, WeInPlanning and hours, requires a facility, and never sets `ownerPartyId` (Marble's NewRunForm and the spec pass none). With a produce product it writes WeptConsume rows from `get#ProductBomDetail`, which is single level and reads PatMfgBom with no date filter, so expired lines count | Warehouse P16a calls it with neither product (D15); P0 confirms. Legacy BOM reads stay for kits and migration comparison only |
| F8 | P0: `set#ProducedProductQuantity` always resets the run's status: WeComplete when every estimate is produced, otherwise WeInProgress, so on a draft or released run it starts the run. Its `recreate#ConsumeProductsFromProduce` deletes every WeptConsume row and rebuilds them from the WorkEffortProductAssoc view, which joins ProductAssoc of any type, not only PatMfgBom | Never called by BOSS (§2); `change#ProductionQuantity` (P7) is the target change |
| F9 | P0: the Default WorkEffort flow has no WeApproved → WeOnHold or WeApproved → WeInPlanning, and allows WeInPlanning → WeComplete, WeComplete → WeInProgress and WeClosed → WeInPlanning; WorkEffortOther adds → WeClosed from every open status. The framework's status check (`moqui-core` `service/call.rs` `check_status`) matches StatusFlowTransition by from and to only, ignoring `statusFlowId`, and skips a record with no status, so any `update#WorkEffort` accepts all three flows' transitions. Nothing leads from WeOnHold back to WeApproved, so a hold before start could only resume by starting | `transition#ProductionOrder` is the only path to a run's status (§2, P5); P5a seeds WeApproved → WeInPlanning with its unrelease guard (Warehouse P16a did not; impl-warehouse §4), and WeApproved → WeOnHold and WeOnHold → WeApproved, the last written into the design; P1 grants no raw update |
| F10 | P0: Mantle REST has `workEfforts` PATCH as an entity update, PUT `add#WorkEffortProduct`, POST `create#ProductionRun`, and the run display, produce-consume and pick reads. Marble's `updateRun` calls plain `update#WorkEffort` | P1 grants the Manufacturing groups no REST run path; P0 checks the other groups |
| F11 | P0: WorkEffortProduct is keyed by run, product and from date, with no unit, so it cannot hold two lines of one product. WorkEffort's `estimatedCost` is commented out; `ownerPartyId`, `actualCost` and the setup times exist. ProductionEstimate exists and is unused | Snapshot lines are the execution identity and the Wept rows a per-product aggregate in the stock unit (design M4); no write to `estimatedCost`; ProductionEstimate stays unused (R-MFG-27) |
| F12 | P0: `issue#AssetToWorkEffort` does not check the asset's status; it checks available to promise, and quantity on hand unless the facility's `assetAllowIssueOverQoh` is Y, which it is for ZIRET_WH. `issue#AnyAssetToWorkEffort` picks AstAvailable assets only | The production issue guard checks status and quantity itself: Warehouse P16b's refuses a held asset (HELD_STOCK) and a shortfall (QUANTITY_EXCEEDS_AVAILABLE) (P5b) |
| F13 | P0: `receive#Asset` takes `acquireCost` from its parameter, else the order item's standard cost or price, so production output without one has none (a TODO names the work effort's cost). The owner defaults to the order's customer, then the work effort's owner, then the facility's; the status to AstAvailable, overridden by the location type's `autoStatusId`. `post#AssetReceipt` with a null cost records AtrNoAcquireCost and posts nothing; a zero cost posts zero | Output and return receipts always pass `acquireCost` (design D12); P6's guard refuses one without it |
| F14 | P0: an issuance posts to WIP only when the work effort's `ownerPartyId` equals the asset's, otherwise to COGS; a receipt with a work effort credits WIP whatever the owner. A run with no owner, as Marble and the spec make them, books issues to COGS and output against WIP | `create#ProductionOrder` sets the owner (Warehouse P16a) and release sets it on the operations; stock carries the run's ID, never an operation's (R-SA-03, R-SA-07). P5 checks the demo runs |
| F15 | P0: `breakDown#Assembly` lowers the kit receipt through `update#AssetAndReceipt`, which calls `repost#Asset` (unpost, delete and re-post) when quantity or cost changes. `unissue#AssemblyComponents` unissues by the kit's current, date-filtered PatMfgBom quantities, and `unissue#Component` cancels the run's issuances in ID order through `cancel#AssetIssuance`, an update that fires AssetIssuanceGlRePost | P9 makes the kit receipt's reduction a dated reversing delta (§4) |
| F16 | P0: `get#InventoryProjectedInfo` reads production demand and supply from the MantleInventoryRunConsume and RunProduce documents: WorkEffortProduct rows of any purpose (pick assemblies too) on work efforts not Complete, Closed or Cancelled, so drafts count. Its facility is the run's facility's parent, meaning a run sits on a line under its warehouse; a run placed on the warehouse itself is missed. It needs search | P1's demo lines sit under ZIRET_WH, and NewWorkOrder puts a run on a line (P5); P13 nets by line and warehouse and tells kits apart |
| F17 | P0: `get#TimesheetApprovers` follows ProjTimesheetPolicy: by default the ProjectManager or Manager WorkEffortParty rows of each entry's project, where the project is the item if a WetProject, else its root, else the item itself; `line` uses the PrtManager relationship; `any` the TIMESHEET_APPROVE holders. `approve#Timesheet` needs an approver other than the owner on a completed sheet. The timers take a work type and a rate type | P10: operations carry the run as root and the supervisor's assignment counts as a manager's; the production rule is written into the design if it reduces to that |
| F18 | P0: the WorkTypes are management, labor, office, breaks, development, design, testing, meeting, support, project management, consulting and travel (the demo adds programming); no production work type. SkillType is seeded with no values. There is no RqtMaintenance request type; the maintenance types are vehicle, HVAC and cleaning, with no corrective type. AsMntCreated exists, and `create#AssetMaintenance` sets no status | P10 seeds the three work types; P1's demo the skill types; P11 RqtMaintenance and MntTpCorrective, and `request#ProductionMaintenance` passes AsMntCreated |
| F19 | P0: Mantle's demo has no production run, routing, line, work center, product maintenance or asset maintenance. ZIRET_WH (owner ORG_ZIZI_RETAIL) is the only facility. PatMfgBom rows exist for DEMO_1_1 and DEMO_3_1 (DEMO_SA_1, DEMO_SA_2, DEMO_RM_1) and DEMO_PA, the only PtPickAssembly kit (DEMO_1_1, DEMO_2_1). EQUIP_AB4 "Assembly Bot 4000" has two assets at ZIRET_WH | P1's demo builds on them |
| F20 | P0: Mantle's `ManufacturingServices.spec.js` (seven features) creates an ownerless run with a produce product, sets the produced quantity, issues, unissues, cancels and breaks down an assembly; it asserts no GL, transition or exact consume quantity. OrderToCashBasicFlow packs DEMO_PA through the pick-assembly services | Both pass unchanged, since ManufacturingServices keeps its behavior (§2) |
| F21 | P0: Marble's Manufacturing has 12 screen files and 23 forms (16 single, 7 list), matching ss-inventory; RunPickDocument is the print. `addRunProduct` calls `add#WorkEffortProduct` | Each maps to design §10.2's destination (P5, P7, P17) |
| F22 | P0: `MethodPolicy.js` reads only permissions, through `ProductAccess.js` (Products P9). Products P9's BossSetupData seeds `BOSS_MANUFACTURING_COST` and grants `METHOD_VIEW` to `_READ`, `_METHOD`, `_METHOD_APPROVE`, `_RESOURCE_ADMIN` and `_COST`; `METHOD_EDIT` to `_METHOD`, `METHOD_APPROVE` to `_METHOD_APPROVE`, `METHOD_RESOURCES` to `_RESOURCE_ADMIN`; `PRODUCT_COST_VIEW` and `METHOD_COST_EDIT` to `_COST`; and all of them with `METHOD_COST_APPROVE` to `BOSS_MANUFACTURING_ADMIN` | P1 adds only the new groups' grants and the production permissions. A cost estimator's cost read and the admin's method rights are these grants, so review I-MFG-09 needs no script change |
| F23 | P0: Projects' timesheet approval is Mantle's (`mantle.work.TimesheetServices` `get#TimesheetApprovers`, `approve#`, `return#` and `reopen#Timesheet`), which `ironstone.projects.TimeServices` calls. A rate changes through BOSS's `store#TimeEntryRates`, a plain `update#mantle.work.time.TimeEntry`, or `get#TimeEntryRate` with reset, so no Mantle timesheet service sees it | P10's hooks are in mr-mantle, the rate delta on the TimeEntry itself; nothing calls `ironstone.projects` |
| F24 | P0: Products P9's `get#BomExplosion` (`Boms.js` `explode`) returns `requirements` that stop at a non-phantom sub-assembly (`planningBoundary`) and, given a facility, a `buildableQuantity` from `get#AvailableInventory` for the BOM's organization; `fullBlowThrough` blows through every level. The tree rows still show every level | P5's producible-now reads `buildableQuantity`; P13 nets from `requirements` level by level (§4) |
| F25 | P0: Products §7 leaves for Manufacturing: its context on Product360, InventoryAvailability and Supplier360 (crosscut §3.5, §3.7, §3.21, §3.23); `check#ProductUsable` callers `run#SupplyPlan`, `convert#PlanningSuggestions`, `create#ProductionOrder`, `release#ProductionOrder`; production's use of released versions (snapshots, `create#ProductionOrder` off `get#ProductBomDetail`); WorkCenter capacity, alternates and load; the BillsOfMaterials, Routings and OperationTemplates screens. Warehouse P16 already built the first two callers: `Production.js` `usable()` calls `check#ProductUsable` (Produce) and `method()` reads ProductBom, not `get#ProductBomDetail` | Product360 → P2; InventoryAvailability → P5; Supplier360 → P14; the planning callers → P13; snapshot use and the create/release callers are done (P5 confirms in its spec); capacity and load → P3 (records) and P12 (load, alternates); the three screens → P2 |
| F26 | P0: Accounting §7 leaves for Manufacturing: ProductionCostClose and CostingPolicies (`mantle.ledger.ProductionCostServices` `store#AllocationPolicy`, `preview#CostClose`, `post#CostClose`; `find#CostCloseQueue`), ProductionAllocationPolicy, the ProductionCostReview topic (not seeded yet in mr-mantle data), Accounting's side of D12 and the cost-close part of §16.3; MyFinanceWork's runs awaiting cost close (from P16); the P11 period-close checks "WIP tie-out against the WIP account and open production runs" and "production runs awaiting cost close", each a `PeriodCloseCheck` row; Manufacturing on EquipmentDetail. Projects' cost posting already excludes production time (`ProjectCosts.js` `projectOf` returns null for a run's operations) | The topic → P6; the rest of the cost close, MyFinanceWork's runs and both PeriodCloseCheck rows → P15 (the plan's P15 names neither the period-close checks nor MyFinanceWork; add them); EquipmentDetail → P3, its Request maintenance → P11. Nothing for P10's labor side beyond F33–F35 |
| F27 | P0: Warehouse §7 leaves for Manufacturing: FacilityDetail, MaterialIssueReceipt, QualityInspection and InspectionTemplates contexts; the Components Stage action (Move) and ReceiveOutput's GenerateTracking; `amend#ProductionOrder`, `ProductionQuantityEvent`, instruction versions, `transition#ProductionOrder` with its hold; the guards' cost events; `record#ProductionLoss`, `request#SubcontractService`, SubcontractDetail; WorkOrders, NewWorkOrder, WorkOrderDetail; CX-PLANNING records and `run#SupplyPlan`/`store#PlanSchedule`; the suggestions on Product360's Replenishment tab; and the kit unused-component return and breakdown that cancel the newest issuances first under `kitCostFromComponents` (F283). The production pick mode stays §7; held quantity in planning is decided | FacilityDetail → P3; MaterialIssueReceipt, Stage, GenerateTracking, the lifecycle and the three WorkOrder screens → P5; cost events → P6; `ProductionQuantityEvent` and `record#ProductionLoss` → P7; QualityInspection and InspectionTemplates → P8; amendments and F283 → P9 (F30); instruction versions are P2's WorkEffortContent rows (§4, no version record); CX-PLANNING records and services → P13, which should also say whether Product360's Replenishment suggestions are its or §7 (unassigned today); subcontracting → P14 |
| F28 | P0: Projects §7 names nothing for Manufacturing. Adjacent items: `view-timeline` and Timeline baselines (P12 extends the `.qvue` Timeline, F4, and Projects' P4c leaves its terminal moves for later); clock-in for another (Time P6a/P6b), which the shared-station operator switch would need; `post#WorkEffortCost` is Accounting's and excludes production | None picked up; P12 keeps Projects' Timeline behavior (F4); the operator switch stays Manufacturing §7 (CX-DEVICE) |
| F29 | P0: with the asset owner's `PartyAcctgPreference.forwardIssuanceRepostEnabled` = Y (`entity/AccountingControlEntities.xml`, default N, audit-logged), every `cancel#AssetIssuance` that `breakDown#Assembly` makes is safe: the `AssetIssuanceGlRePost` SECA calls `repost#AssetIssuance`, whose `IssuanceAdjustments.js` leaves the posted history alone and posts one AcctgTrans dated now for (what should be posted − what was posted), idempotent by its `ia:` operation key, so it works in an open period and after the issue's period is closed or locked (AccountingControls spec covers the hard lock). The delta is a full recomputation: the debit account comes from the current mapping and the work effort's current owner, the cost from `ForwardInventoryCosts.at(asset, issuedDate)`, so any other drift is swept into it. With the flag off, the legacy path unposts and deletes the original and re-posts it at its old date, and `unpost#AcctgTrans` errors in a closed period, so the breakdown rolls back | P9's guard needs the flag on for the issuances' owner (as §4 says) and refuses naming it otherwise; nothing more on the issuance side |
| F30 | P0: the issuance side has two quantity problems. `unissue#Component` cancels a component's issuances oldest first, while `KitCost.js` values each kit at the next slice of issuances in issue order, so reversing a later kit at different component costs leaves a WIP residue when `kitCostFromComponents` = Y (Warehouse §7, F283). Its shipment branch (`assemblySisList`) takes `min(sis.quantity, quantityRemaining)` per ShipmentItemSource, mixing the kit's quantity with the component's and not bounding it by the issuance, so with several issuances a cancel can exceed one issuance's quantity and `cancel#AssetIssuance` errors ("Quantity to cancel … is greater than"). Also it unissues by the kit's current, date-filtered PatMfgBom (F15) | `reverse#SupportedAssembly` calls `breakDown#Assembly` with `unissueAssemblyComponents=false` and makes the cancels itself: the issuances of the slices KitCost used for the kits reversed, newest first, each `cancel#AssetIssuance` with an explicit quantity, and refuses when the issued quantities differ from those slices. A P9 spec with two packs at different component costs checks WIP nets to zero (not run here) |
| F31 | P0: `breakDown#Assembly` lowers `quantityAccepted` through `update#AssetAndReceipt`, which calls `repost#Asset` (receipts, then issuances, then physical-inventory variances of the kit asset). `repost#AssetReceipt` has no delta: it unposts and deletes the kit receipt's AcctgTrans and posts a new one at the receipt's `receivedDate`. In an open period the original transaction is gone and the new one is back-dated to the receipt day (no reversing pair, a new ID). In a closed period `unpost#AcctgTrans` errors ("time period closed") and the breakdown rolls back. The same call re-posts the kit's other issuances (a delta with F29's flag, else unpost/re-post) and its count variances (always unpost/re-post). With `kitCostFromComponents` = N the kit was received without cost (AtrNoAcquireCost), posted nothing, and the receipt repost is a no-op | P9 adds F32's receipt delta. Its guard refuses a kit asset with physical-inventory variances (no delta for them) and runs only with both flags on |
| F32 | P0: what P9 adds: a forward delta in `mantle.ledger.AssetAutoPostServices.repost#AssetReceipt`, `ReceiptAdjustments.js` beside `IssuanceAdjustments.js`, which posts (quantityAccepted × acquireCost, Dr inventory / Cr WIP for a work-effort receipt, else the receipt account) − the posted history as one AcctgTrans dated today with an operation key, leaving the original. The flag is Accounting's: `forwardReceiptRepostEnabled` on `PartyAcctgPreference` (AccountingControlEntities.xml, audit-logged, default N, added to `AccountingSetup.js` and `SetupServices.xml`'s preference lists), read for the asset owner, like `forwardIssuanceRepostEnabled` and per impl-accounting's Oct 28/Oct 30 rows (Accounting's flags live on PartyAcctgPreference). It is not a ProductionPolicy flag, since `repost#AssetReceipt` serves every receipt correction (also F39's `update#AssetAcquireCost`). A `receivedDate` change keeps the legacy path | Write into §4 and design Disassembly: "Disassembly needs `forwardIssuanceRepostEnabled` and `forwardReceiptRepostEnabled` on the kit owner's PartyAcctgPreference". §2's "behind its own ProductionPolicy flag" reads as Accounting's flag for these two. The receipt delta's spec tests the flag off (unchanged legacy) and on (open and locked period) |
| F33 | P0: the production approver rule already reduces as F17 hoped. `release#ProductionOrder` (`Production.js`) creates the operations as WetTask with `parentWorkEffortId` and `rootWorkEffortId` = the run, so under the default `project` policy `get#TimesheetApprovers` takes the run as the operations' project, and time on the run itself takes the run. Its ProjectManager or Manager WorkEffortParty rows approve. The supervisor in a Manager role on the run is enough, with no change to `get#TimesheetApprovers`. It does not reduce to the design's union, "the run's supervisor or the person's line manager": `line` uses PrtManager and falls back to the run managers only when the person has none, and `any` uses TIMESHEET_APPROVE holders. Approval is per week, so any approver of any project in the week approves all its entries (a project manager approves production time, and a run supervisor approves project time) | Write the design rule as "the organization's timesheet policy, the run being its operations' project and the supervisor a Manager on the run". Drop the ProductionPolicy approver flag and the `get#TimesheetApprovers` change. The line-manager union and per-entry approval go to §7, or get a flagged change if the user wants them |
| F34 | P0: the hook point has a precedent. `approve#Timesheet` and `reopen#Timesheet` call `mantle.ledger.OtherAutoPostServices.post#WorkEffortCost` after the status update; `TimeServices.store#TimeEntry` calls it for an entry of an approved week or one already posted; `delete#TimeEntry` calls it to reverse. `ProjectCosts.js` posts per entry (what should be posted while the sheet is approved − what was posted, keyed `wec:` + entry), so approve, reopen and edits are one idempotent delta. `return#Timesheet` is Completed → In-Process and had nothing approved, so it needs no hook. Approval reaches `update#Timesheet` only through these services (BOSS `ironstone.projects.TimeServices` calls them too) | P10: `mantle.work.ProductionServices.sync#ProductionLaborCost` (timesheetId, or timeEntryIdList and deleting) at the same four call sites, writing `record#ProductionCostEvent` deltas per entry whose work effort is a WepProductionRun or its operation, keyed by entry and revision. It does nothing for other entries, so Projects' behavior is unchanged. A missing costing rate records unvalued and adds no error. It sits behind a ProductionPolicy flag of the run's owner (§2). Alternative without touching TimesheetServices: an EECA on Timesheet `statusId` to or from TmshApproved (get-original-value) plus an EECA on TimeEntry when a cost field changes (F35), both in the same transaction |
| F35 | P0: the labor event's value never depends on the TimeEntry rate fields. Design Y2 values it at a `RateAmount` by `emplPositionClassId` and `workTypeEnumId`, never `vendorHourRate`, so F23's rate paths (`store#TimeEntryRates`, a plain `update#TimeEntry` of client and vendor rates, and `get#TimeEntryRate` with reset, which resets the rateAmountIds and rates) change no production cost. What changes it: `hours`, `breakHours`, `fromDate`, `workTypeEnumId`, `emplPositionClassId`, `workEffortId` and `partyId`. These change through `store#TimeEntry` and `delete#TimeEntry`, which refuse a submitted or approved week under the default lock, or through a plain entity update. A costing RateAmount correction is no TimeEntry change at all | F23's "rate delta on the TimeEntry itself" narrows to those fields (F34's call sites, or the TimeEntry EECA for plain updates). The event freezes `rateAmountId` and amount at approval. A RateAmount correction reaches a run through P15's review re-recording it, as unvalued machine runtime does (§4). Write into design ProductionTime |
| F36 | P0: `TimeEntryUpdateTask` (`entity/Work.eecas.xml`) runs `update#TaskFromTime` on every time change, which sets the operation's `actualWorkTime`, `actualCost` (hours × vendorRateAmount, the pay rate) and `actualClientCost`. `WorkEffortUpdateProject` (any WetTask with a root) then runs `update#ProjectTimeFromTask`, which overwrites the run's `actualWorkTime`, `estimatedWorkTime`, `remainingWorkTime`, `actualCost` and `actualClientCost` with the TaskTimeSummary of its operations. Commons `get#TaskAccess` returns those fields to anyone who sees the operation (only clients lose them) | Production never reads or writes WorkEffort `actualCost` or the work times of a run (extends F11). F38's guard keeps operations off the task surfaces, which also stops that read |
| F37 | P0: no BOSS group reaches a run through REST or `add#WorkEffortProduct`. `/mantle` (MANTLE_API) is authorized for ADMIN only, and `/mantle/my` has no work-effort path. No BOSS screen or service calls `add#WorkEffortProduct`, `create#ProductionRun` or a raw run update. The ironstone `update#mantle.work.effort.WorkEffort` calls are on projects (`get#ProjectAccess` requires WetProject), events and calendar items | F10 closes for REST; P1's ManufacturingAccess spec asserts a Manufacturing or Projects user gets 403 on `/rest/s1/mantle/workEfforts` |
| F38 | P0: a run's operations are tasks to Commons and Projects. They are WetTask, rooted at the run and owned by its organization. Commons (ALL_USERS): `check#TaskUpdate` and `get#TaskAccess` let an Assignee (or the owner party) Mark done from Today (`update#Task` → WeComplete), reschedule, `set#TaskStatus` to In Planning, In Progress, On Hold, In Review, In Testing, Complete or Cancelled, and `update#TaskField`. Projects (`Shared/WorkItemDetail`, `WorkItemServices.update#WorkItemField`, bulk `moveToProject`) also gives canUpdate to any non-client WorkEffortParty of the root run (a supervisor, or operators assigned on the run) and to a Manager on the operation: any status of the flow, estimates, parent, and `rootWorkEffortId` (moving it out of the run). `mantle.work.TaskServices.update#Task` and `set#TaskStatus` check no type. So a Projects or Commons user assigned to an operation can change its status, past `complete#ProductionOperation` and `PRODUCTION_OPERATE`. The run itself is WetEvent: `get#TaskAccess` refuses it, and Commons event edits need the organizer (owner = the organization) or a calendar editor, so its status is out of reach unless a run is put in a calendar | P1 (before P5's assignments): `get#TaskAccess` and `check#TaskUpdate` (BOSS, no Mantle change) treat a WetTask whose root is a WepProductionRun as not a task: found false for Projects, canUpdate false and a message pointing to the shop floor in Commons. P10 (F41) keeps Mark done off them in Today. Optional: a Mantle refusal in `update#Task` and `set#TaskStatus` behind a ProductionPolicy flag. P12 adds no run to a calendar (CalendarWorkEffort). ManufacturingAccess covers each path |
| F39 | P0: Commons `duplicate#Event` (EventServices) needs only view access. A run is visible to every user of its owner organization (`get#RecordLinkInfo`: ownerPartyId of it or its root) and to its parties. The copy goes through `clone#WorkEffort`, whose `copyProduct` defaults to true, so the result is a new WetEvent WepProductionRun owned by the user, In Planning, with WeptConsume and WeptProduce rows. `get#InventoryProjectedInfo` counts those (F16). Runs also show as events in Commons Calendar, EventDetail and Today to their parties | P1: `get#EventAccessInfo` (BOSS) treats a WepProductionRun as not an event (not found), so EventDetail, duplicate and the event edits refuse it. P5 checks that Today and Calendar leave runs out, through F41's exclusion |
| F40 | P0: the approval contract (impl-accounting F43, F132; impl-drawers-commons M2). A topic is a framework `NotificationTopic` seeded in mr-mantle data, with `inboxEnumId` NinNotifications. It counts as an approval (`get#UserNotifications` `approvals: true`, the tray's decide buttons, `approvalCount`) only when it has `approveServiceName`, with `refuseServiceName` and `refuseReasonRequired` as options, like TimesheetApproval. Accounting's BillApproval-style topics have none and are decided on the record, whose service marks the notification read. An app's Approvals screen (`Accounting/Approvals.xml`) sets `notificationTopics` and mounts `Commons/Notifications.xml`, which passes them as `topicList`. The root's `<shell-providers><notification-topic topic=…/>` lists them for the shell. BOSS data sets `linkTemplate` (BossAccountingSetupData). The sender notifies only the organization's users holding the deciding permission (`request#PayableApproval`) | P2 (method approval), P6 (ProductionCostReview), P9 (substitution, amendment), P14 if any: neutral topic names in mr-mantle data, sent by the Mantle verb to holders of the deciding permission. `Manufacturing/Approvals.xml` mounts Notifications with its topics, BOSS `linkTemplate`s go to WorkOrderDetail or the method, and the topics go in Manufacturing.xml's `<notification-topic>`. Decide on the record (no approveServiceName), since substitution and amendment need a preview; the decision service marks them read. Production timesheets stay on Projects' TimesheetApproval topic |
| F41 | P0: the Today provider is `<today-source service=… label="Manufacturing"/>` in the app root's shell-providers (`crates/moqui-core/src/screen/shell.rs`). `get#UserTodayItems` calls it in its own transaction with userId, partyId, fromDate and thruDate. It returns `{items, label}`, each item carrying the base fields (workEffortId, requestId, dueDate, startDate, endDate, allDay, priority, statusId, assignees, canUpdate, hasCallLink) plus kind, title and url. A failing source is logged and named. The pattern is `ironstone.warehouse.HomeServices.get#TodayItems` with `Today.js` (scope check, own user only, a source per kind, each failure-tolerant, the same rows as Home's Your work). The catch: Today's built-in group already lists an assigned operation (WetTask with the user's WorkEffortParty and a due date) with canUpdate, so the operations would appear twice and offer Mark done (F38). A run the user is a party on shows as an event | P10: `ironstone.manufacturing.HomeServices.get#TodayItems` lists the user's due operations (kind `productionOperation`, canUpdate false, url to OperationExecution, the run as record), and Home's work list reuses it. `get#UserTodayItems` (Mantle) leaves out WetTask rows rooted at a WepProductionRun and WetEvent rows with that purpose. That changes only what is displayed, and plain Mantle runs have no WetTask operations, but it is a Mantle change, so it gets a test of plain Mantle's unchanged output |
| F42 | P1: Products P8's released methods for DEMO_1_1 are spec fixtures (ProductsMethodFixtures), not demo data | P2 seeds a released demo method |
| F43 | P1: Warehouse's demo run `BOSS_WH_RUN` is WetTask, while `create#ProductionRun` makes WetEvent (F7) | The F38/F39 guards key on `purposeEnumId`, so both are covered; P5 may align the Warehouse demo |
| F44 | P1: F38's guard also refuses time on an operation through Projects' timers and TimeEntries and Commons' `clockIn#Task` and `add#TimeOnTask` | P10's ProductionTime provides the production time path |
| F45 | P1: a run's record link fell through to Commons (EventDetail or TaskDetail) | It opens Manufacturing, else Warehouse's MaterialIssueReceipt, else nothing |
| F46 | P1: Projects team users have no authorization for `get#RecordLink` | Unchanged; outside Manufacturing |

## 7. Later

Designed, not in this build:

- **The design's `later` rows:**
  - AssemblyViewer and WallDisplay (the `BOSS_MANUFACTURING_DISPLAY` group is seeded in P1, with nothing to open);
  - Nonconformances and Gauges, with crosscut CX-QUALITY's NCR, CAPA and calibration;
  - DemandForecasts, MasterSchedule and FiniteSchedule;
  - CustomerMaterialJobs (inward processing);
  - Batches and BatchDetail (M9).
- **Other design items:**
  - merging compatible drafts (R-MFG-40);
  - WhereUsed's Draft replacement revisions, and the ChangeNotices link from compare (R-MFG-32);
  - the variant-applicability editor (Products P8 adds `applicabilityFeatureIds`, which the explosion reads);
  - the design §14 items: component reservation and a production pick mode with `AssetReservation.workEffortId`,
    general unbuild of produced output, a shared-station operator switch (decided, design §13 L5; it waits on the
    framework device credential, CX-DEVICE), and deferred cost posting;
  - General manufacturing unbuild; kit disassembly is P9's (§4).
- **The rest of supply planning (CX-PLANNING):** Purchasing's mount and its conversion of ordinary buy suggestions to
  POs or purchase requests, Warehouse's mount and its transfer conversion, and RequestDetail's buy and make
  requirements with their RequirementSupply links (impl-warehouse §7).
- **Other apps' contexts:** Purchasing, Warehouse and Customer Service on the shared screens Manufacturing builds first
  (ProductionCostClose, SupplyPlanning), beyond Accounting's on ProductionCostClose.
- **Other apps' callers:** Purchasing placing and approving the service PO, and its supplier portal's subcontract view
  (design SubcontractDetail, External access); the Maintenance app adopting the AssetMaintenance records.

## 8. Verification

- **Per phase,** the "Done" rule of §2 and the phase's "usable when".
- **End to end,** run `./moq run`, sign in as `john.doe` and as each demo production user, and walk each built phase's
  "usable when" in order.
- **Design §10.3's acceptance review and crosscut §6,** scenario by phase:

| Scenario | Phase |
| --- | --- |
| Product variant to supplier price, partial receipt and failed inspection | P5b and P8 (held stock is never issued); the receipt, bill and payment are Purchasing's, Warehouse's and Accounting's |
| Shortage to buy, make or transfer, partial production, finished stock and GL | P13 (conversion), P5 (release and issue), P7 (partial output, loss and returns), P6 and P15 (cost and GL) |
| Order reservation, pick shortfall, substitute or replan | P9 (substitute), P8 (pegged reservation at release); shipment and invoice are Warehouse's and Accounting's |
| Customer return, inspection, rework or scrap | P7 (rework and scrap), P8 (disposition); credit and refund are Accounting's |
| Physical count while production issues and receives | P5b's movements under Warehouse's count cutoff (its P10) |
| Intake, assignment, reopen and resolution | P11 (downtime and quality requests); SLA and CSAT are Customer Service's |
| Released BOM or routing changes; missing instruction | P9 (amendment), P10 (the instruction gate); the gauge is §7 |
| Cancellation, partial completion and retry | P5 (cancel and retry), P7 (partial), P9 (split); batches are §7 |
| Unauthorized action and standalone app | `ManufacturingAccess` in every phase; P17 |
| Subcontract dispatch and output receipt | P14, on Warehouse P15 and P16 |
| Production cost close (design-accounting §16.3 production-to-GL) | P15 |

- **Screenshots** through the BOSS client spec of §2, light and dark, and the handheld mounts at phone width.
