# IronStone BOSS — Accounting implementation

P0–P5 are built and reviewed (R for P0–P3, R2 for P4–P5, with its rework). Work is paused before P6. P6–P21
remain planned. The delivery log is below; the contracts are in
[AccountingImplementation](../docs/AccountingImplementation.md).

How [design-accounting.md](design-accounting.md) gets built, in phases from the foundation to base-currency
posting, each ending tested and usable. This file is kept at a high level, as [impl-products.md](impl-products.md)
and [impl-projects.md](impl-projects.md) are: each phase names its scope by the design's sections and §18 needs
rather than restating them, and the design stays the place for screen and record detail. During the build this
file is the log: phase status and what each built, the decisions made, open questions, findings against the
code, and what is deferred.

Before P0, `screen/Accounting/` held nine placeholders and its root grant was inactive. P0–P3 now provide the
scoped shell and minimal document routes, guarded ledger, reports and settings. Products' existing costing and
revaluation contracts remain the integration baseline. Full document workflows and shared customer/supplier
screens follow in their later phases.

## 1. Scope and order

**Current execution boundary (Oct 30, 2026):** P4–P5 reviewed and reworked on Mantle's services (R2), then a pause
before P6. The later phase definitions remain the plan for a future continuation.

- **Repositories.** Each is its own git repo:
  - `mr-moqui` (`crates/`, `runtime/base-component`)
  - `runtime/component/mr-mantle`
  - `runtime/component/mr-boss`, the internal app
  - `runtime/component/mr-pass`, the customer and supplier pages as PASS apps (P18; §4)

  `runtime/component/mr-marble` is read only, for the baseline Accounting, Asset and Party screens that design
  §16.1 maps.
- **Scope.**
  - Every `parity` and `new` row of design §2, and the §18 needs they use: AC-01 to AC-14 and AC-18 to AC-22,
    with the first-release parts of AC-16 (dated rates) and AC-20 (transfers and deposits).
  - The parts of other apps' needs that Accounting depends on (§4):
    - crosscut CX-ORDER-HOLD: `OrderHoldReason`, `hold#Order` and `release#OrderHold`;
    - crosscut CX-PORTALS: `ExternalAccessServices`, and two PASS apps in mr-pass, Billing for customers and
      Supplier for suppliers, in place of the ServicePortal and SupplierPortal roots, with Accounting's pages only;
    - Purchasing's SupplierProfile, its finance fields only;
    - Warehouse's `receive#ReturnItems`;
    - crosscut CX-AUTOMATION: the Mantle rule changes of design §1.4.
  - The shared screens no app has built, with the Accounting context only: Customer360, ShipmentDetail,
    EquipmentDetail, ReturnDetail and InvoiceMatch. Accounting's context on Projects' InvoiceDetail and
    OrderDetail, and on Products' Product360, Supplier360 and InventoryValuation.
  - §7 holds the `later` rows and needs, ProductionCostClose and CostingPolicies, and the rest of the other
    apps' needs.
- **Order** (decided Oct 28, 2026):
  1. the foundation;
  2. the ledger and its posting guard;
  3. settings;
  4. receivables;
  5. payments and settlement;
  6. payables: bill intake, holds and approval;
  7. matching;
  8. payment runs;
  9. banking;
  10. collections, credit and recurring invoices;
  11. period close;
  12. fixed assets;
  13. inventory valuation and landed costs;
  14. tax;
  15. budgets;
  16. reports;
  17. returns and order changes;
  18. portals, as PASS apps;
  19. setup and activation;
  20. base-currency posting;
  21. the finish.

  A report that a phase's walk needs comes with that phase: TrialBalance and GeneralLedger with the ledger,
  Aging with collections, InvoiceReconciliation with close, StockTransactions with valuation, and
  BudgetVariance with budgets.

## 2. Ground rules

- **The Commons rules hold.** These are impl-drawers-commons §4:
  - failure tolerance;
  - the Mantle-free framework;
  - Mantle stands without BOSS: no Mantle code or spec calls `ironstone.*`, reads BOSS or names a BOSS group;
  - business logic leans to Mantle;
  - the new XML element checklist of style-guide §8.1;
  - libraries through `libs/refresh.mjs`, and crates against `deny.toml`;
  - the `.qvue` gallery pattern;
  - parties by role;
  - changes by effective date and the audit log;
  - demo data;
  - builds and commits.

  The walks are BOSS `test/client` specs, as Products' are (impl-products §2). No spec takes screenshots; a walk
  asserts what a page shows.
- **Use Mantle first.** Before adding a service, entity or guard, find the Mantle service that already does it and use
  it, or extend it with a parameter: payments through `create#`/`update#Payment` and `post#Payment`, so their SECAs
  run; applications through the `apply#*` services; refunds through `create#RefundPayment`; gateway operations through
  the `*#SinglePayment` services and their gateway interfaces; invoice print, email, statements and credit memos through
  `get#InvoicePrintInfo`, an `EmailTemplate`, `get#ReceivableStatementInfo` and `create#InvoiceCreditMemo`. Add beside
  Mantle only what it lacks (docs/dev/Practices-App-Dev.md §3; F115).
- **Financial writes through Mantle services.** Every invoice, payment, settlement, stock-value and period
  mutation is a Mantle service that checks its permission, the organization, status, balance, lock date and
  operation key (design §1.1). An Accounting screen or mount calls it after `ironstone.accounting.AccessServices`
  has checked the capability group and the organization. No same-named `ironstone` pass-through is built, and
  other apps call the Mantle name.
  - A Mantle service checks its Moqui permission through Products P9's `ProductAccess.js` `has()`, and the
    organization by party relationship (`get#PartyOrganizationInfo`), never a BOSS group. BOSS grants the
    permissions to its groups (P1). A permission check goes on a new Mantle service only.
  - An `ironstone.accounting` service keeps only the capability check, a screen's reads, shapes and saved views,
    the settings forms, and the call to Mantle.
  - `entity` in a design form summary means an access-checked read or a configuration-record write, never raw
    financial state (design §1.3).
  - Permissions are checked in the Mantle services and capabilities in AccessServices, so they hold for imports,
    exports, search, the palette and shared mounts. Mantle's existing ledger and report services check no access
    (F6), and several accounting records have no entity filter (F5), so no Accounting screen calls them without
    AccessServices first, and P16's report runs add the checks in Mantle.
- **One posting choke point.** The AC-06 guard runs inside Mantle `post#AcctgTrans` (P2), so direct posting,
  every auto-post SECA and each Accounting posting service, all of them Mantle's, pass it (F9). The
  `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_*` groups get no artifact authorization for `unpost#AcctgTrans`, `update#AcctgTransPosted`, the
  `repost#*` services or the Mantle REST mutators (F11). Only the finance-admin data-repair actions reach a raw
  rewrite (design §1.1, §19).
- **Preview, then post.** A preview answers a version. The post takes that version and an operation key,
  re-reads under lock and refuses a stale preview; a retry with the same key answers the first result (design
  §18.1; F8). Both are one Mantle service pair, keyed on the CX-POSTING record (§4; F47); a payment's review is a
  `PaymentReview` row holding its operation key and result (R2). One financial transaction, application set,
  transfer or document-and-ledger posting is atomic; a bulk selection names each failure and goes on.
- **Restricted values stay on the server.** Bank and card numbers are masked and gateway secrets stay Admin's.
  An inaccessible account contributes no names or amounts, and a failed aggregate is unavailable, never zero
  (design §3).
- **One currency until P20.** Mantle converts no currency (F19). From P4, finalizing or posting a document whose
  currency is not the organization's base currency is refused, and Setup readiness says so (D18).
- **Shared screens.** Accounting builds these with the Accounting context only:
  - `Shared/Customer360`, `Shared/ShipmentDetail`, `Shared/EquipmentDetail`, `Shared/ReturnDetail` and
    `Shared/InvoiceMatch`.

  InvoicePay and SupplierBillUpload are not BOSS screens: they are pages of PASS apps (below).

  It adds its context to `Shared/InvoiceDetail` and `Shared/OrderDetail`, and to Products' `Shared/Product360`,
  `Shared/Supplier360` and `Shared/InventoryValuation` (F4). Each takes `appRoot` and server-derived
  capabilities, on `Shared/RequestDetail`'s pattern (F2).
- **Public pages in mr-pass, internal ones in mr-boss** (§4). The customer and supplier pages are PASS apps, on
  PASS's foundation (design-forum §1, §4, §5), as impl-customer-service §2 sets out for its Support app:
  - PASS's public shell with host and app-mount routing; server-rendered HTML with qvue enhancement, at 390 px and
    on the desktop; no terminal UI, which PASS does not have yet.
  - Public accounts hold only `ALL_USERS`. A customer or supplier contact reaches its records through Mantle's checks
    of its relationship and of `ExternalAccessCapability`, never a UserGroup, so there is no `BOSS_SERVICE_PORTAL` or
    `BOSS_SUPPLIER_PORTAL`.
  - Pages call the authority only through `pass.Facade.call#Operation`: an operation in PASS's `Schema.js`, its route
    in `Routes.js`, served to a remote frontend by Mantle's PassApi. So every service a page calls is Mantle's, and
    what it calls is Mantle's too; no `ironstone.*` service, BOSS screen or BOSS group.
  - PASS's request contract (design-forum §4.3), and its media staging and scanning for uploads.
  - A bearer link is a page of the app that takes its token, as PASS's Unsubscribe does, checked by
    `check#AccessToken`; no `<token-route>` in BOSS's `MoquiConf.xml`.
- **Owner contracts.** A contract built here for another app follows that app's design: its package, its record
  and service names, its Shared screen, and the permissions its Mantle services check. A change found while
  building it is written into the owner's design. The owner's own screens stay with the owner.
- **A new control is the one behavior.** Each CX-AUTOMATION change, and each new refusal in an existing Mantle
  service, is how Mantle behaves from then on, with a test of its condition (crosscut §7.1). Only a control that would
  break Mantle's flow specs (F27) stays behind a flag, off by default, listed in §4 with the reason; today that is
  `postingGuardEnabled` (R2).
- **Existing callers stay compatible.**
  - Mantle's specs pass unchanged, including the flow specs' SECA invoices, return responses and posted
    amounts (F27).
  - Projects' Billing passes unchanged: the Billing, BillingWalk, ClientBilling and MilestoneBillingWalk specs.
    Projects' `update#InvoiceStatus` calls `mantle.account.InvoiceServices.change#InvoiceState` (D6), and its
    `send#Invoice` calls that file's `send#Invoice` (F2).
- **Done for a phase** means all of these:
  - impl-projects §2 "Done":
    - cargo tests for the touched crates, with goldens reviewed;
    - the new Mantle specs passing under `./moq test mr-mantle` without mr-boss, their users in spec-local groups
      holding the permissions;
    - `./moq test mr-boss` passing, with AppStructure covering the new screens and Accounting in its
      non-placeholder list (F3);
    - `moqui lint --screens` clean for BOSS with the Debug binary;
    - the `test/client` walks passing;
    - the inventories' **Implemented in** columns;
  - the `AccountingAccess` spec extended to the phase's services and mounts;
  - for P18: `./moq test mr-pass mr-mantle mr-boss` with the apps' specs, the remote pair on PASS's RemoteFixtures
    pattern, `moqui test-client mr-pass --serve` on ForumHttp's and RemoteHttp's pattern, with the phone-width
    overflow checks at 390 px, and lint clean for PASS;
  - the phase's walk in §8;
  - its row and **Built** note here.

### P0 — Checks

Verify the design's riskiest assumptions against the code before building. Each result is a row in §6 and,
where it changes the design, an edit there. F1–F46 were found on Oct 28 while writing this plan; the design
edits that F17, F25, F27 and F40 call for, and those of §4's decisions in design-accounting and crosscut (among
them InvoicePay and SupplierBillUpload, and the audience roots of crosscut §2, §5 and D5 with their groups in §1.4),
were made in the Oct 28 design sweep. The Billing and Supplier apps in design-forum §1 and §13 are added when P0
closes. Completed checks (findings F48–F60; verification below):

- **REST.** Which Mantle REST mutators reach invoices, payments and accounting transactions, and what the BOSS
  groups would reach through them (F6, F11).
- **Palette documents.** Whether Mantle has search documents for invoices, payments, GL accounts and journal
  entries for the palette types, or P1 adds them.
- **Inspection quantity.** What "open inspection" reads before CX-QUALITY exists (D21).
- **A gateway for InvoicePay.** Mantle's `TEST_APPROVE` gateway always approves; InvoicePay's pending and
  declined paths need a test gateway that can answer them.
- **PASS for its first apps beyond Forum** (§4). How an app registers: its `PublicSiteApp` mount and target,
  navigation, readiness and operator configuration; the facade's operation and route catalogues and Mantle's PassApi
  route table; PASS invitations with organization grants; media staging finalized into a record's content; and the
  URLs Mantle builds for a site's pages (impl-customer-service F43). Also `Pass.xml`'s content security policy
  (`form-action 'self'`, `frame-ancestors 'none'`) against the gateway's hosted page or redirect, and PASS's
  local-return-path rule for the gateway's return.
- **Products' state.** Which of Products P2, P6 and P9 are built when P6 and P13 start.

### P1 — Foundation

- **AC-01, access.**
  - The groups of design §1.1, with `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_MATCH` (crosscut §1.4), `BOSS_ACCOUNTING` as the root
    user group and `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_ADMIN` as the admin group (§4). `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_GL` exists from Products P1.
  - The root's authz comes out of BossSetupData's commented block (F1), with the organization filters of
    impl-drawers-commons §4: `MANTLE_USER_ORG` for the groups, `MANTLE_ACTIVE_ORG` for the admin group (F5).
  - `ironstone.accounting.AccessServices`: the user's organizations and capabilities. Every Accounting screen and
    shared mount calls it before the Mantle service, and a supplied organization or record is checked against it.
  - **Permissions** (§2, §4): Mantle seeds Accounting's `UserPermission` rows beside `ORDER_APPROVE` in
    `MantleSetupData.xml`, and BossSetupData grants them with `UserGroupPermission` rows. `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_ADMIN`
    holds every one below, and alone holds `ACCOUNTING_ADMIN` and `FISCAL_REOPEN`. No group gets `GL_POST_CLOSED`
    (F9).
    - `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_AR`: `RECEIVABLE_EDIT`, `CUSTOMER_CREDIT_VIEW`;
    - `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_AP`: `PAYABLE_EDIT`, `PAYABLE_IMPORT`, `INVOICE_HOLD`, `INVOICE_MATCH`, `SUPPLIER_TERMS_EDIT`;
    - `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_MATCH`: `INVOICE_MATCH`;
    - `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_TREASURY`: `PAYMENT_EDIT`, `BANK_RECONCILE`;
    - `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_GL`: `BUDGET_EDIT`, beside Products' `ACCOUNTING_VIEW`, `ACCOUNTING_GL_POST` and
      `PRODUCT_COST_VIEW`;
    - `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_TAX`: `TAX_STATEMENT_EDIT`;
    - `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_READ`: `CUSTOMER_CREDIT_VIEW`, beside Products' `ACCOUNTING_VIEW` and `PRODUCT_COST_VIEW`;
    - `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_APPROVE`: `ACCOUNTING_VIEW`, `INVOICE_APPROVE`, `INVOICE_HOLD_RELEASE`,
      `PAYMENT_RUN_APPROVE`, `FISCAL_CLOSE`, `CREDIT_HOLD_RELEASE`, `BUDGET_OVERRIDE`, `RETURN_CREDIT_APPROVE`,
      `PRODUCTION_COST_POST`;
    - Projects' `BOSS_PROJECT_MANAGER`: `RECEIVABLE_EDIT`, since its Billing calls `change#InvoiceState` and
      `send#Invoice` (§2).
  - No artifact authorization for the restricted services of §2, or for the Mantle REST ledger paths (F6).
- **The Accounting root.**
  - The menu of design §1.2: the placeholders renamed, and Payments, PeriodClose, FixedAssets, Inventory,
    Records and Approvals added (F1). Each area shows for its groups only.
  - `<shell-providers>`: palette types and sources for invoices, payments, parties, accounts and journal
    entries, and quick create of an invoice, bill, payment or draft journal entry, each checking its group.
    Today and the notification topics grow phase by phase (AC-18).
  - The `accounting` key scope.
  - `ironstone.commons.PaletteServices.get#RecordLink` opens invoices, payments and journal entries under
    Accounting.
- **Home** (design §3): AccountingSummary and MoneyCards over `ironstone.accounting.HomeServices.get#Summary`,
  with the counts of later phases null, and MyFinanceWork with no sources yet.
- **Accounting demo data.**
  - `BossZAccountingDemoData.xml` uses the demo's own organization, `BOSS_ACCT_ORG` (defined in
    `BossAccountingUsersDemoData.xml` with Mantle's default accounting configuration), outside the Ziziwork rollup,
    so its adopted controls do not reach Mantle's demo flows (F7). Mantle seeds no accounting transactions, so a demo service runs the
    invoices, payments and postings the phases need, as Projects' demo services do.
  - `BossUsersDemoData.xml` gains a user per group (AR, AP, treasury, GL, tax, reader, approver and admin), and a
    report reader with no other launcher.
- **Specs.**
  - `AccountingShell`: the menu per group, the palette, record links, quick create.
  - `AccountingAccess`: started, covering organization scope and groups through AccessServices, and the
    permissions through the Mantle services.
- **Usable when:** the menu renders for each group, and quick create offers only what the group may create. A
  report reader sees their organization's invoices, payments and accounts but not another organization's, in
  lists, the palette and record links.

### P2 — Ledger and posting guard

Built in two parts: P2a the guard and the core screens, then P2b batches, templates, dimensions and attachments.

- **P2a.**
  - **AC-06, the guard,** inside `mantle.ledger.LedgerServices.post#AcctgTrans`, beside its period check (F9):
    - proposed `mantle.ledger.config.AccountingLock` (typed lock-through dates) and `AccountingLockException`
      (soft and expiring; never relaxing a hard lock or `TimePeriod.isClosed`);
    - the organization, and the operation identity;
    - `verifyOnly` made free of side effects (F9);
    - `mantle.ledger.CloseServices.store#Lock` and `grant#Exception` (`ACCOUNTING_ADMIN`).
  - **Mantle ledger fixes** (each keeping Mantle's default):
    - `repost#AssetIssuance` posts a dated reversing delta in an open period instead of unposting and deleting
      (R-SA-02; design §1.4's `AssetIssuanceGlRePost` row; F11);
    - `post#ReverseAcctgTrans` takes a reversal date, and marks the original reversed only when the reversal
      posts (F12);
    - fiscal periods follow the organization's fiscal-year start (F13);
    - `GlAccountOrganization` gains its from and thru dates (F14).
  - **Screens** (design §8 and §9):
    - ChartOfAccounts (tree and list) and AccountDetail;
    - JournalEntries, with bulk post and a result per transaction;
    - JournalEntryDetail: balanced lines; post, and reverse with a date and reason; delete of drafts; the move
      dialog; the audit. Posted entries are read only, and the metadata correction is
      `mantle.ledger.JournalServices.update#PostedMetadata`, audited and limited, not `update#AcctgTransPosted`
      (F11);
    - TransactionEntries;
    - Periods and PeriodLocks.
  - **Reports** (design §13): TrialBalance and GeneralLedger, with the shared report options and drill-down.
    TrialBalance reads closed periods' summaries and sums open periods' posted entries (§4; F16).
- **P2b.**
  - **AC-13:** `AcctgTransTemplate` and `AcctgTransTemplateEntry`; `mantle.ledger.JournalServices`
    `store#Template`, `store#TemplateLines`, `create#FromTemplate`, `validate#Batch` and `post#Batch`, checking
    `ACCOUNTING_GL_POST`. The batch posts each transaction on its own and names each failure, in place of
    `post#GlJournal` (F17). JournalBatches and JournalTemplates.
  - **AC-22:** `AcctgTransEntry.facilityId` and `costCenterId`, AccountDetail's RequiredDimensions on
    `GlAccountOrganization`, and the posting refusal of an entry missing a required dimension (F15). The
    source-line fields and their copy come in P6.
  - **AC-21:** `AcctgTransContent`, registered in `get#RecordLinkInfo`, for JournalEntryDetail's Files.
- **Usable when** (design §16.3 bank-to-close, its closed-period part):
  - a GL user creates, balances and posts a manual entry, then reverses it on a later date with a reason, and
    the posted entry stays read only;
  - a backdated posting into a locked or closed period is refused by a direct post, and an auto-post SECA's
    goes to the error journal with the lock named, while a soft exception lets one named user post one scope until
    it expires;
  - a batch with one unbalanced entry posts the others and names the failure.

### P3 — Settings

- **Screens** (design §15):
  - Settings: the index, with readiness;
  - AccountingPreferences, with ClonePreferences' conflict preview (`mantle.ledger.SetupServices.clone#Preferences`,
    `ACCOUNTING_ADMIN`). The COGS method is shown for what it is: Mantle posts actual cost whatever it says (F40);
  - PostingDefaults: the mappings by kind, `ProductGlAccount` and `ProductCategoryGlAccount` among them, and
    the missing-mapping queue over `get#DefaultGlAccountByType`, which also lists the transactions sent to the
    error journal for a missing account (F10). The type defaults include the revaluation offset type
    `GatInventoryRevaluation` that Products P9 seeds, mapped for the demo organization (§4; F47);
  - PaymentTerms: due terms, and from P8 the term lines (§4);
  - Currencies: currency units and dated rates, the only writer of either (D17; Products Units excludes them;
    F20);
  - PaymentMethods: masked methods and gateway bindings; secrets stay Admin's;
  - DocumentSettings: numbering, kept on `PartyAcctgPreference` where Mantle reads it, and templates, with the
    preview of `ironstone.accounting.DocumentServices`.
- **Usable when:** a finance admin sets an organization's preferences, maps an invoice item type that
  PostingDefaults listed as missing, and adds a dated rate and a due term. A GL user who is not an admin is
  refused each.

### P4 — Receivables

- **AC-02, the invoice controls.**
  - `mantle.account.InvoiceServices.change#InvoiceState`, the one invoice state guard over Mantle's status
    flow (F18): status, period, posting, hold (D6), and the single-currency refusal (D18). It checks
    `RECEIVABLE_EDIT` or `PAYABLE_EDIT` by side, and `INVOICE_APPROVE` for approval. Projects'
    `update#InvoiceStatus` calls it, so project invoices are refused too (F46).
  - `send#Invoice`, with or without a store: it renders the invoice as sent and its attachments, stores the PDF as the
    invoice's content stamped with its time (impl-drawers-commons §4), sends through an `EmailTemplate` and records
    the outcome as its EmailMessage rows (F21; R2). Projects' `send#Invoice` calls it (F2). The InvoicePay link is
    added in P18.
  - `InvoiceFinalizedSendEmail` skips a version `send#Invoice` has sent (CX-AUTOMATION).
  - `process#InvoiceBatch`, and the duplicate-source guard. It and `send#Invoice` check `RECEIVABLE_EDIT`.
- **Screens** (design §4):
  - Invoices, with CreateReceivable and InvoiceBatch;
  - InvoiceDetail: `Shared/InvoiceDetail` with the receivables context (F2) and the tabs of design §4. Its
    credit memo is linked to the invoice and applied through `apply#InvoiceToInvoice` (F22). Projects' context
    and client view are unchanged;
  - BillingQueue, over Projects' approved time;
  - Statements, over `get#ReceivableStatementInfo`, grouped by currency (F19), and sent through
    `mantle.account.CollectionServices.send#Statements` (`RECEIVABLE_EDIT`);
  - Customer360: `Shared/Customer360` (crosscut §3.2) with the Accounting context, its Contact, Orders,
    Invoices/payments and Agreements tabs, and the PaymentDetails, PartyIdentifications and TaxRegistrations
    forms (D26), finance-gated and masked. Credit and Activities come in P10.
- **Outputs:** the invoice and credit memo print, shared with Projects' (F2); the customer statement.
- **Usable when** (§16.3 invoice-to-cash, its first part):
  - an AR user creates, finalizes and sends a customer invoice without a store, and its email outcome is
    recorded;
  - a store invoice is not sent twice;
  - a batch send with one bad address names it and sends the rest;
  - an invoice in a foreign currency cannot be finalized;
  - a project invoice approved and sent from Projects behaves as before.

### P5 — Payments and settlement

- **AC-02, settlement.**
  - `mantle.account.PaymentServices.find#OpenItems` and `apply#Settlement` (`RECEIVABLE_EDIT` or `PAYABLE_EDIT` by
    side): a preview, then one atomic application set per party and currency, under the operation key (F8). A
    discount or write-off is a posted adjustment to an explicit account, not Mantle's write-off status (F23).
  - `PaymentServices.autoApply#Payment`, an empty stub today (F24), implemented over the same `find#OpenItems`.
  - `PaymentServices.change#PaymentState`, the guarded payment status transition (validate, deliver, void;
    `PAYMENT_EDIT`), with the PaymentValidation topic.
- **AC-20, transfers:** the `PtInternalTransfer` payment type (F31), its cash-in-transit `PaymentTypeGlAccount`,
  and `PaymentServices.create#InternalTransfer` (`PAYMENT_EDIT`): one payment from the organization to itself, whose
  `post#Payment` posts both sides through transit, and a fee as its own payment, all or nothing (R2).
- **Screens** (design §6 and §4):
  - Payments, with its tabs, NewPayment and InternalTransfer;
  - PaymentDetail: applications, gateway actions, refunds linked to the original, evidence, and the payment
    date under the lock;
  - GatewayTransactions;
  - ReceivablesWorkbench.
- **Usable when** (§16.3 invoice-to-cash, settlement; access):
  - a partial receipt and an available credit apply to an invoice in one confirmed set, and a retry applies
    nothing twice;
  - a write-off without an account is refused;
  - a transfer between two bank accounts posts both legs through transit, or neither;
  - an AR-only user cannot capture a gateway payment or read bank numbers.

### P6 — Payables

- **Purchasing's contract** (§4, PUR-SUPPLIER; F29):
  - `mantle.party.supplier.SupplierProfile`, effective-dated by organization and supplier (`fromDate`, `thruDate`),
    with `settlementTermId` and `selfBillingIndicator` only, both audit-logged (impl-drawers-commons §4);
  - the finance fields of `mantle.party.SupplierServices.store#SupplierProfile`, which need `SUPPLIER_TERMS_EDIT`
    (its buyer fields need Purchasing's `SUPPLIER_PROFILE_EDIT`).

  The rest of the profile stays Purchasing's.
- **AC-02, bill intake** (D2):
  - `mantle.account.InvoiceServices.import#Bill`, keyed by organization, supplier and supplier reference, or by
    shipment for a self-billed draft. A repeat is refused, naming the earlier bill. It needs `PAYABLE_IMPORT`: it
    takes an upload from AP intake, and from a Purchasing buyer (`BOSS_PURCHASING_BUYER`, seeded with Manufacturing
    P14, which grants it the permission) for a bill on a PO of an organization the buyer belongs to (§4);
    Purchasing's Bills mounts it in its P6;
  - `create#InvoiceFromSource` (`PAYABLE_EDIT`), on the ordered or the accepted received basis, applying order
    payments; from the InvoiceFromSource dialog of OrderDetail and ShipmentDetail;
  - `approve#Payable` (`INVOICE_APPROVE`);
  - the due-date rule takes SupplierProfile's term for a bill, after the agreement's and before
    PartyAcctgPreference's (R-ACC-16; F28).
- **AC-03, holds:**
  - `mantle.account.invoice.InvoiceHold` and its seeded reasons;
  - `mantle.account.InvoiceServices` `hold#Invoice` (`INVOICE_HOLD`), `release#InvoiceHold`
    (`INVOICE_HOLD_RELEASE`, never by the placer) and `request#HoldRelease` (`PAYABLE_EDIT`), with
    `ironstone.accounting.MatchServices.find#BillExceptions` for the screens;
  - the hold guard inside Mantle, where a payment is applied to a payable invoice, behind its flag (§4): it
    covers `apply#Settlement`, payable `create#InvoicePayment` and `apply#InvoicePayment`, and the SECAs below.
- **CX-AUTOMATION**, each change behind its flag (§4; F27):
  - `ShipmentIncomingDeliveredCreateInvoices` runs only for a self-billing supplier, and
    `create#PurchaseShipmentInvoices` takes `acceptedOnly`, which bills accepted quantity and no leftover or
    service line (F26);
  - `PaymentApplyForInvoice` and `InvoiceApplyForPayments` leave a held bill's payment unapplied, with a named
    exception.
- **AC-22, the sources:** `OrderItem.costCenterId` and `InvoiceItem.costCenterId`, copied with the facility by
  the invoice and payment auto-post services.
- **Screens** (design §5 and §14):
  - Bills: its tabs, CreatePayable, BillUpload, and HoldInvoice on a selection;
  - BillDetail: `Shared/InvoiceDetail` with the payables context. Its Match tab comes in P7;
  - ExpensePosting;
  - Supplier360: Products' `Shared/Supplier360` gains the Accounting context. Its tabs are Bills/payments and
    Agreements/terms (the SupplierProfile terms and self-billing flag). It also gains PaymentDetails, through
    `create#BankAccount` and `update#BankAccount` behind the treasury guard (F30), PartyIdentifications and
    TaxRegistrations;
  - OrderDetail: `Shared/OrderDetail` with the Accounting context (Header, Items, Invoices/payments,
    Fulfillment, History);
  - ShipmentDetail: `Shared/ShipmentDetail` (crosscut §3.8) with the Accounting context;
  - Approvals: the Commons Notifications mount, filtered by Accounting's approval topics (§4; F43), with the BillApproval and
    BillHoldRelease topics. Later phases add theirs.
- **Usable when** (§16.3 procure-to-pay, intake and holds):
  - a receipt from a supplier that is not self-billing creates no bill, and one from a self-billing supplier bills
    accepted quantity only;
  - a second upload with the same supplier reference is refused, naming the first;
  - a bill from a PO through InvoiceFromSource takes the supplier's terms;
  - a held bill cannot be approved or paid, manually or by a payment that names it;
  - the placer cannot release the hold, and an approver's release is recorded;
  - OrderProcureToPayBasicFlow passes unchanged.

### P7 — Matching

- **AC-03, the match.**
  - `InvoiceMatch`, `InvoiceMatchLine` and `InvoiceMatchPolicy`.
  - `mantle.account.InvoiceMatchServices` `evaluate#InvoiceMatch`, `apply#InvoiceMatch` (writes or updates
    `OrderItemBilling`) and `unapply#InvoiceMatch` (reverses it), checking `INVOICE_MATCH`; `store#MatchPolicy`
    (`ACCOUNTING_ADMIN`); and `queue#MatchReevaluation`, called from the AssetReceipt and InvoiceItem EECAs, with
    its background job, all in mr-mantle.
  - Quantity under open inspection is excluded as P0 settles. Service lines wait for Purchasing's acceptance
    (§7).
  - `InvoiceMatchPolicy` as effective-dated rows with their key fields audit-logged; a match line keeps the policy
    row it applied (impl-drawers-commons §4).
  - The legacy match backfill (design-purchasing §18), `InvoiceMatchServices` `preview#LegacyMatches` and
    `apply#LegacyMatches`: it links existing bill lines to orders and receipts only from unambiguous OrderItemBilling
    and AssetReceipt evidence, names each ambiguous line as a match exception and goes on, and never matches an
    unexplained balance. AP and a buyer with the match group (`INVOICE_MATCH`) run it, from MatchPolicies here and
    from Purchasing's MatchExceptions (§4).
- **Screens:** `Shared/InvoiceMatch` (crosscut §3.22) with the Accounting context, opened from BillDetail's Match
  tab; MatchPolicies.
- **Usable when** (§16.3 procure-to-pay, matching):
  - a bill against a partial accepted receipt matches within tolerance, and excess or already-billed quantity is
    refused;
  - a price outside tolerance holds the bill, naming the rule;
  - a changed receipt marks the match stale and the job re-evaluates it;
  - no hold is released automatically.

### P8 — Payment runs

- **Payment terms** (§4): `SettlementTermLine` as effective-dated rows,
  `mantle.account.InvoiceServices.store#SettlementTerm` (`ACCOUNTING_ADMIN`), and the per-invoice
  `InvoiceDueSchedule` written at issue, which aging, the workbench, runs and `apply#Settlement` read; a discount
  taken within its date posts to the discount account.
- **AC-04.**
  - `mantle.account.payment.PaymentRun` and `PaymentRunItem`.
  - `mantle.account.PaymentRunServices` `create#Run` and `select#Bills` (`PAYABLE_EDIT`), `approve#Run`
    (`PAYMENT_RUN_APPROVE`) and `execute#Run` (`PAYMENT_EDIT`), with `ironstone.accounting.PaymentRunServices.find#Runs`
    for the screens. Execution re-reads holds, bank details and the version under lock, and gives each supplier
    payment one instruction identity.
  - The PaymentRunApproval topic.
  - A supplier's bank-detail change voids a pending approval of a run that pays them (D26), through
    `PaymentRunServices.void#RunApproval`, a SECA on `update#BankAccount`. The void keys on the supplier, since
    Mantle moves a changed bank account to a new payment method (F30).
  - A bank return that declines a payment reverses its posting and unapplies it, so the bill is open again
    (F32).
- **Screens** (design §5): PayablesWorkbench, with ApplySupplierCredit; PaymentRuns; PaymentRunDetail, with
  checks, NACHA and Positive Pay through the existing services, and bank returns through `import#NachaReturn`.
  The discount columns read the due schedule.
- **Usable when** (§16.3 procure-to-pay and batch):
  - a run selects the due approved bills and excludes a held one with its reason;
  - after approval, one supplier's payment fails and the others keep their payments and file;
  - regenerating downloads the same file;
  - a bank-detail change voids the approval;
  - a NACHA return reopens the bill it paid.

### P9 — Banking

- **AC-05.**
  - `mantle.account.method.BankReconciliation`, `BankReconciliationLine`, `BankMatchRule` and `StatementImport`.
  - `mantle.account.ReconciliationServices`, checking `BANK_RECONCILE`:
    - `preview#CsvStatement`, `review#StatementImport` and `commit#StatementImport`. A line's identity is the
      bank's FIT id where the format has one (OFX), and a source-row key otherwise (BAI2, CSV; F33);
    - `create#`, `store#` and `finish#Reconciliation`, with `ironstone.accounting.BankServices.find#Reconciliations`
      for the screens;
    - `store#Rule` and `test#Rule`. Every candidate shows; a rule applies only an exact, unambiguous match (F33).
- **AC-20, deposits:** `PaymentDeposit`, `Payment.paymentDepositId` and
  `mantle.account.PaymentServices.create#DepositSlip` (`PAYMENT_EDIT`).
- **Screens** (design §7 and §15):
  - BankAccounts;
  - BankAccountDetail, whose reconcile, unreconcile and no-reconcile row actions keep parity on their own
    (R-ACC-25), with DepositSlip;
  - StatementImport: BAI2, OFX and CSV;
  - Reconciliations and ReconciliationDetail, sequential lists on terminal;
  - UnmatchedTransactions and BankRules;
  - FinancialAccounts and FinancialAccountDetail.
- **Usable when** (§16.3 bank-to-close, the bank part; batch):
  - a statement with a duplicate and a malformed row imports the rest and lists both, and the same BAI2 file
    imported twice adds nothing the second time;
  - an ambiguous rule suggests and does not apply;
  - two sessions cannot clear one line;
  - a statement with a difference cannot be finished;
  - a deposit's one bank line reconciles once.

### P10 — Collections, credit and recurring invoices

- **CX-ORDER-HOLD** (§4; F29): `mantle.order.OrderHoldReason`, and `mantle.order.OrderServices.hold#Order` and
  `release#OrderHold`. A release returns the order to Approved only when no other reason is open; nothing uses
  `OrderBeingChanged`.
- **AC-11, credit.**
  - `CustomerCreditPolicy` and `CreditHoldDecision`.
  - `mantle.account.CreditServices` `store#Policy` and `store#Defaults` (`ACCOUNTING_ADMIN`), `evaluate#OrderCredit`,
    `release#CreditHold` (`CREDIT_HOLD_RELEASE`) and `get#CustomerCreditStatus` (`CUSTOMER_CREDIT_VIEW`), the hold
    and its reason that Customer Service reads. `evaluate#OrderCredit` runs as a SECA in mr-mantle on
    `check#OrderPreApprove`, adding a warning that stops Mantle's auto-approval (F34), and in the guard of every
    BOSS approve action.
  - The CreditHoldRelease topic, and OrderDetail's hold banner.
- **AC-10, collections.**
  - `CollectionPromise`, `DunningLevel`, `DunningRun` and `DunningNotice`.
  - `mantle.account.CollectionServices` `record#Activity`, `store#Promise`, `preview#Dunning` and `send#Dunning`
    (`RECEIVABLE_EDIT`), and `store#Level` (`ACCOUNTING_ADMIN`), with
    `ironstone.accounting.CollectionServices.find#Work` for the screens.
  - `send_SalesInvoicePastDueEmails` stays paused.
- **AC-09, recurring invoices.**
  - `InvoiceSchedule` and `InvoiceScheduleOccurrence`.
  - `mantle.account.RecurringInvoiceServices` `store#Schedule` and `preview#Period`, with its ServiceJob's
    `generate#Invoices` (`RECEIVABLE_EDIT`), and `ironstone.accounting.RecurringServices.find#Schedules` for the
    screens.
  - `create_RecurringOrders` shown with its last result (D24).
- **Screens:** Collections, Dunning, CollectionPolicies and RecurringInvoices; Customer360's Credit and
  Activities tabs; the Aging report (design §13) over `mantle.ledger.LedgerReportServices.run#Aging`, as of a
  chosen date, with Mantle's aging view fixed (F36).
- **Today and notices:** collection follow-ups, credit holds, recurring-generation failures.
- **Usable when** (§16.3 invoice-to-cash, overdue and credit; batch):
  - an order over its customer's limit is held on approval, by Mantle's auto-approval and by a BOSS approve
    alike; it keeps its reservations, and a credit manager releases it with a reason;
  - a dunning run excludes a disputed invoice, and one failed recipient does not resend the rest;
  - a retried generation of a recurring schedule makes one draft;
  - Aging for a past date buckets the same on H2 as on Postgres.

### P11 — Period close

- **AC-06, close.**
  - `AccountingCloseRun`.
  - `mantle.ledger.CloseServices.get#Checklist`: unposted documents, imbalance, unmatched bank lines, AP holds,
    missing rates, the error-journal transactions (F10), the stock and WIP tie-out, and the rows of design §9
    PeriodCloseDetail.
  - `CloseServices.close#Period` (`FISCAL_CLOSE`) commits the closing entries, `close#FinancialTimePeriod` and the
    snapshot at once. Mantle's close is fixed to count only the organization's unposted transactions, and its
    closing entries to use the organization's own net-income account (F37). `reopen#Period` (`FISCAL_REOPEN`) is
    audited and keeps the old close.
- **Project cost** (§4; F45): `mantle.ledger.OtherAutoPostServices.post#WorkEffortCost`, on project timesheet
  approval behind its flag: approved project time at the entry's cost rate to project cost, from the labor clearing
  account, keyed by time entry, with a dated reversing delta when the approval is undone or the entry changes.
  Production time is left to Manufacturing (D12). The two GL account types are seeded and mapped in
  PostingDefaults.
- **The period-run contract:** `mantle.ledger.transaction.AccountingPeriodRun` and its results, with
  `mantle.ledger.PeriodRunServices.preview#Run`, and `ironstone.accounting.PeriodRunServices.find#Runs` for the
  screens. P12's depreciation is its first kind.
- **Screens:** PeriodCloseDetail and PeriodRuns; the InvoiceReconciliation report, over
  `mantle.ledger.LedgerReportServices.run#InvoiceReconciliation`.
- **Usable when** (§16.3 bank-to-close, close):
  - close is blocked by an unposted invoice and an unreconciled statement, each named and linked;
  - once they are fixed, the period closes, and another organization's open work did not block it;
  - a backdated invoice, refund and reversal are then refused alike.

### P12 — Fixed assets

- **AC-07, the books.**
  - `mantle.product.asset.FixedAssetClass`, effective-dated rows with their key fields audit-logged, beside the
    `AssetClass` enumeration it replaces as the source of defaults (F38), and the book event types of
    `AssetBookEvent`, which Products P9 made for the revaluation (F47).
  - `mantle.ledger.AssetBookServices`, which Products P9 began with the revaluation, adds:
    - `store#Class` (`ACCOUNTING_ADMIN`), with `ironstone.accounting.AssetBookServices.find#Classes` for the
      screens beside Products' `get#RevaluationContext`;
    - `capitalize#Asset`, `adjust#AssetBook`, `dispose#Asset` and `reverse#AssetBookEvent` (`ACCOUNTING_GL_POST`);
    - `preview#Depreciation`, `get#DepreciationPreview` and `post#Depreciation` (`ACCOUNTING_GL_POST`): each
      asset-period once, over the existing calculate and post services, never
      `calculateAndPost#AllFixedAssetDepreciations`. A depreciation that does not post leaves no depreciation row
      (F38).
- **Screens:**
  - FixedAssets, AssetClasses and DepreciationRunDetail;
  - EquipmentDetail: `Shared/EquipmentDetail` (crosscut §3.10) with the Accounting context: identity, the Book
    pane with its four dialogs and AcquireCostRepair (finance admin only, in an open period; F39), source and
    history.
- **Usable when** (§16.3 bank-to-close and batch):
  - an asset is capitalized from its class, then depreciated for a period with one asset failing and the rest
    posted;
  - it is adjusted, and disposed with a gain or loss, and a book event is reversed in an open period;
  - depreciation into a closed period is refused.

### P13 — Valuation and landed costs

- **InventoryValuation** (design §10): the rest of Products' `Shared/InventoryValuation`, around its P9 dialogs,
  at `Accounting/Inventory/InventoryValuation`:
  - `mantle.product.InventoryReportServices.run#InventoryValuation` over `AssetValuationSummary`, which values
    stock at each asset's current cost, set beside the inventory and WIP account balances (F40). A revaluation
    moves both by on-hand × delta, so they still agree after one;
  - ValuationExceptions: the `AtrNoAcquireCost` and `AtrNoAcctgPreference` movements, zero-cost receipts, and
    movements whose posting went to the error journal (F40);
  - CostDataRepair: finance admin, audited, in an open period (F39).

  Warehouse's mount is §7.
- **AC-07, the revaluation from Products P9** (§4; F47): the dialogs call `mantle.ledger.AssetBookServices`
  `preview#Revaluation` and `post#Revaluation` (`ACCOUNTING_GL_POST`), behind the organization's revaluation flag,
  off by default. A post changes forward cost (§4): it sets the on-hand assets' `acquireCost` from its date,
  without reposting history, and posts one AcctgTrans for on-hand × delta against the revaluation offset account
  (P3), never calling `update#ProductAcquireCost`.
- **AC-07, landed costs:** `mantle.account.invoice.LandedCostAllocation`, and `AssetBookServices.preview#LandedCost`
  and `post#LandedCost` (`ACCOUNTING_GL_POST`). The on-hand share goes to the asset's cost and the issued share to
  COGS or variance.
- **AC-07, for Manufacturing's cost close:** the GL account types `GatLaborApplied`, `GatOverheadApplied`,
  `GatOutsideProcessAccrued` and `GatProductionVariance`, and `AssetTypeGlAccount.scrapGlAccountId` (§4).
- **Scrap by reason** (impl-warehouse §4): `post#PhysicalInventoryVariance` reads the organization's
  `VarianceReasonGlAccount` row for the variance reason, then for a scrap reason the asset type's
  `scrapGlAccountId`, and otherwise found or shrinkage by sign as before; the demo organization's InVrScrap and
  InVrExpired rows are seeded.
- **Screens:** InventoryValuation; LandedCosts, linked from BillDetail; Product360: Products' `Shared/Product360`
  with the Accounting context (Summary, Costs/history, source movements, permitted Prices, and the GL mappings pane
  of §4); the StockTransactions report, over `mantle.product.InventoryReportServices.run#StockTransactions`.
- **Usable when** (§16.3 production-to-GL, the valuation part):
  - a freight bill line allocated by weight to two receipts raises the on-hand asset's cost and sends the
    consumed share to COGS, with ledger links, and cannot be allocated twice;
  - a receipt without a cost basis shows in ValuationExceptions and in P11's checklist;
  - the valuation and the inventory account agree for the demo organization, or the difference is listed;
  - a revaluation from a changed estimate sets the on-hand cost from its date and posts on-hand × delta to the
    offset account; a later issue posts at the new cost, and the valuation and the inventory account still agree
    (Products P9);
  - with the organization's revaluation flag off, the post is refused.

### P14 — Tax

- **AC-08** (F41).
  - A corrected, active `mantle.other.tax.TaxAuthorityRate`, keyed to `TaxAuthority` by its own id.
  - `calculate#SalesTaxLocal` and `calculate#InvoiceSalesTax`, implemented, with the organization fallback for
    invoices without a store. Tax lines post to the authority's account.
  - A tax error blocks finalization in `change#InvoiceState`.
  - `mantle.other.TaxServices` `store#Rate` (`ACCOUNTING_ADMIN`), and `export#Statement` and the 1099 runs
    (`TAX_STATEMENT_EDIT`), with `ironstone.accounting.TaxServices.get#StatementDetail` for TaxStatementDetail.
- **Screens** (design §11): TaxAuthorities; TaxRates, with TaxSimulation; TaxStatements and TaxStatementDetail.
  The first release has the US 1099 data and local sales tax only (design §20).
- **Usable when:**
  - a sales invoice without a store gets its local tax lines by organization policy, with the authority, rate
    version, base and rounding stored;
  - an invoice whose tax cannot be calculated cannot be finalized;
  - a sales-tax statement for a period lists its invoice lines;
  - 1099 data is generated per vendor, with failures named.

### P15 — Budgets

- **AC-14.**
  - The Budget status items and flow, which Mantle declares no items for (F42).
  - Budget amounts audit-logged, so a revision is its time and BudgetVariance reads a budget as of one; the approved
    budget's PDF stored as its content. The organization comes from the budget's period, and other parties are
    BudgetParty rows (impl-drawers-commons §4).
  - `BudgetControlPolicy`, effective-dated rows with their key fields audit-logged, and
    `mantle.other.budget.BudgetCommitment`.
  - `mantle.other.BudgetServices` `revise#Budget` (`BUDGET_EDIT`), `store#Policy` (`ACCOUNTING_ADMIN`),
    `check#Budget` (its Stop override `BUDGET_OVERRIDE`), `reserve#Commitment`, `convert#Commitment` and
    `release#Commitment`, each idempotent per source revision, with
    `ironstone.accounting.BudgetServices.find#Exceptions` for the screens.
  - `approve#Payable` (P6) converts a PO's commitment to actual.
  - The BudgetOverride topic. Purchasing's callers are §7.
- **Screens:** Budgets, BudgetDetail and BudgetControls; the BudgetVariance report, with its committed column
  and actuals net of credits (F42).
- **Usable when:**
  - an approved budget's revision keeps the old numbers;
  - a commitment reserved and converted is not counted again as actual;
  - an over-budget expense under Stop is refused, and an override needs a reason.

### P16 — Reports

- **AC-12:** the report runs in Mantle's report files, over the existing report services and views. Each checks
  the organization and that the periods are its own, which Mantle's report services do not (F6). Each answers
  as-of, incomplete and error metadata, and drill-down keeps organization, date and currency.
  `mantle.ledger.LedgerReportServices.run#PartnerLedger` and `mantle.sales.SalesReportServices.run#SalesAnalysis`
  come here, after `LedgerReportServices.run#Aging` (P10) and `run#InvoiceReconciliation` (P11), and
  `mantle.product.InventoryReportServices.run#StockTransactions` and `run#InventoryValuation` (P13).
  `ironstone.accounting.ReportServices` keeps the Reports catalog, its quick options, and the print and export
  shapes.
  Date filters and drill-downs preserve the source's captured `accountingDate` when present, including documents
  created and approved in different time zones; later applications and forward reversals retain their own dates.
- **Screens** (design §13): Reports, the catalog with its quick options; BalanceSheet, IncomeStatement,
  CashFlow, RetainedEarnings, FinancialRatios, PartnerLedger, AccountBalance, PostedSummary and SalesAnalysis.
- **Home complete:** every card and MyFinanceWork source of design §3.
- **Usable when:**
  - each report runs for the demo organization, drills to its source, and prints and exports the same rows;
  - a reader of one organization sees no other organization's balances through any report or export, including
    SalesAnalysis' top products and customer classes (F6).

### P17 — Returns and order changes

- **Warehouse's contract** (§4, WH-RETURN): `mantle.shipment.WarehouseTaskServices.receive#ReturnItems`, checking
  `STOCK_RECEIVE`, which Warehouse grants its groups. It sets `ReturnItem.receivedQuantity` and processes no
  responses, replacing `ShipmentDeliveredReturnReceive` and `ReturnReceivedProcess` on this path. Warehouse's
  ReturnReceipt screen stays Warehouse's.
- **CX-AUTOMATION**, behind D11's flag (§4): `ReturnApprovedProcess` keeps only
  `create#ReturnShipment` (D11).
- **AC-02, returns:** `mantle.order.ReturnServices.preview#ReturnSettlement` and `settle#Return`: a credit needs
  `RECEIVABLE_EDIT` (a supplier's `PAYABLE_EDIT`), a refund `PAYMENT_EDIT`, and a receiptless credit
  `RETURN_CREDIT_APPROVE`.
  - The customer branch calls `process#ReturnItemResponses` inside the settlement.
  - The supplier branch is new code: Mantle refuses responses for a purchase return (F35).
  - Both cover the result codes of design §14, a receiptless credit with an approver, `complete#ReturnItem`, and
    `ReturnItemBilling.assetReceiptId`. Settlement queues match re-evaluation.
- **AC-02, between pack and ship** (D3, behind its flag; §4, F25): the pack SECA leaves the sales invoice
  InvoiceInProcess with no payments applied, and a ShipShipped SECA finalizes it, applying captured payments and
  sending it; `mantle.account.InvoiceServices.release#ShipmentDraftInvoice` and
  `mantle.account.PaymentServices.refund#OrderPayment` (`PAYMENT_EDIT`) serve the changes in between.
- **Screens:** ReturnDetail: `Shared/ReturnDetail` (crosscut §3.18) with the Accounting context.
- **Usable when** (§16.3 return-to-refund; invoice-to-cash, the reopened package):
  - approving an RMA creates no credit;
  - receiving part of it credits only that part, a second box later is still credited, and a refund stays
    within the original paid amount;
  - a supplier return creates the payable credit;
  - a package reopened after pack takes its lines off the shipment's invoice, which is finalized only when the
    shipment ships;
  - ReturnToResponseBasicFlow and OrderToCashBasicFlow pass unchanged.

### P18 — Portals

Accounting's customer and supplier pages, as two PASS apps in mr-pass (§2, §4), on CX-PORTALS.

- **CX-PORTALS** (§4; F29): `mantle.party.ExternalAccessCapability`, and `mantle.party.ExternalAccessServices`
  `create#AccessCapability`, `check#AccessCapability`, `revoke#AccessCapability` and `check#AccessToken`.
- **The PASS apps**, in place of crosscut §5's audience roots (F44):
  - Billing (`screen/Billing.xml`, the `billing` mount): a customer's invoices, with InvoicePay;
  - Supplier (`screen/Supplier.xml`, the `supplier` mount): a supplier's documents, with BillUpload. Purchasing P16
    adds its home, QuoteResponse and OrderAcknowledgement.

  Each is a `PublicSiteApp` with the organization as its target, under PASS's `Pass.xml`, with its navigation,
  readiness and operator configuration on Forum's pattern. They are the first PASS apps beyond Forum, so P18 settles
  how an app registers, which Purchasing P16 and Customer Service's Support app follow.
- **Links and contacts.**
  - An invoice's pay link opens InvoicePay. A PO's link opens BillUpload for that PO: AP issues its capability from
    OrderDetail through `create#AccessCapability`; Purchasing P16 adds OrderAcknowledgement to the same link, and its
    `send#PurchaseOrder` issues one capability for both. Each link is a page taking its token, checked by
    `check#AccessToken` (§2).
  - A signed-in customer or supplier contact is a PASS public account, invited through a PASS invitation bound to
    the app and to the customer or supplier; redeeming it makes the relationship Mantle checks. No UserGroup.
- **AC-02, portal services**, in Mantle so a PASS page can call them, locally or remotely:
  `mantle.account.PortalServices` `issue#InvoiceAccess`, `get#Invoice`, `start#InvoicePayment`, `get#PaymentResult`,
  `submit#SupplierBill` and `get#Submission`, each calling `check#AccessCapability` first, each an operation in
  PASS's `Schema.js` and `Routes.js` served by Mantle's PassApi. `send#Invoice` adds the pay link, the Billing page
  of the organization's site. `submit#SupplierBill` takes its files through PASS's media staging and scanning and
  makes the incoming draft through the core of `mantle.account.InvoiceServices.import#Bill` (P6), with the
  capability check in place of `PAYABLE_IMPORT`.
- **Screens:** InvoicePay (PublicInvoice, PayInvoice, PaymentResult) in Billing, the gateway's return coming back to
  a registered local path of the app; BillUpload, with SupplierBillUpload's forms, in Supplier. Both at 390 px and on
  the desktop.
- **Demo:** a PASS site for ORG_ZIZI_RETAIL with the Billing and Supplier mounts, a customer contact and a supplier
  contact as invited PASS accounts, and token fixtures for the specs.
- **Usable when** (§16.3 access, procure-to-pay):
  - a customer's link shows only that invoice, with no Chatter, cost or rates, and an expired or foreign token
    says unavailable;
  - a redirect return never marks the invoice paid, and a pending payment resumes;
  - a supplier upload creates an incoming draft, a repeat answers the first submission, and it never approves a
    bill;
  - the same pages through a remote PASS frontend with only framework, webroot and PASS installed, and Forum's
    walks unchanged.

### P19 — Setup and activation

- **AC-01, activation.**
  - `mantle.ledger.config.AccountingSetupRun`.
  - `mantle.ledger.SetupServices`, checking `ACCOUNTING_ADMIN`:
    - `preview#OpeningBalances`;
    - `import#OpenItems`: real invoices and bills with an opening flag, at their own due dates, against migration
      clearing;
    - `check#Readiness`: the rows of design §15 Setup, among them single currency, the WIP and transfer accounts,
      and the paused reminder job;
    - `activate#Accounting`, once per run version.
  - The chart templates (§4; F14): a seeded template organization from Mantle's installed chart, copied by
    `init#PartyAccountingConfiguration`.
- **Screens:** Setup. Home offers it first to an unconfigured organization.
- **Usable when** (§16.3 batch/activation):
  - a new organization's opening trial balance and open items tie before activation;
  - one bad open-item row is named and the rest kept;
  - activating twice posts once;
  - aging, dunning and a payment run work on the imported items.

### P20 — Base-currency posting

- **AC-19** (CX-FX; F19, F20):
  - the invoice and payment auto-post services and `post#AcctgTrans` convert to
    `PartyAcctgPreference.baseCurrencyUomId`;
  - the decimal rate, its date and source are stored on the transaction and the document, and
    `originalCurrencyUomId` and `originalCurrencyAmount` are filled;
  - `post#PaymentApplication` books realized FX to `GatForExGain` or `GatForExLoss`, which get their default
    mappings;
  - the single-currency refusal and its readiness row go.
- **Usable when** (§16.3 invoice-to-cash, currency): a foreign-currency invoice posts at its rate and is paid at
  another, and the difference is booked; the GL summaries hold base currency only; Setup no longer says single
  currency.

### P21 — Finish

- The terminal twins, and the server-static pass.
- The §16.3 access walk: an Accounting user of one group with no other launcher is refused the other groups'
  actions and other organizations' records, through URLs, shared mounts, imports, exports and search.
- The §17 outputs not built earlier.
- The inventories' **Implemented in** columns, the design's Impl column, and Remaining-Work.

## 4. Decisions

These are made before and during the build. Each one that changes the design is also written into
design-accounting.md, or into the owner's design.

| Date | Decision | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Phase order: the ledger and its posting guard first; then settings, receivables, payments, payables, matching, payment runs, banking, collections and credit, close, assets, valuation, tax, budgets, reports, returns, portals, setup and base currency | The user's call. The alternatives were the §16.3 flows first, and tax before invoices |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Accounting builds the parts of other apps' needs it depends on: crosscut CX-ORDER-HOLD (P10); Purchasing's SupplierProfile finance fields (P6); Warehouse's `receive#ReturnItems` (P17); crosscut CX-PORTALS with the PASS Billing and Supplier apps (P18); and the CX-AUTOMATION rule changes of design §1.4, each in the phase of its path. These keep the owner's names, packages and Shared screens. The rest of each need, and the owner's own screens, stay with the owner | The user's call, as Products decided for its own. The alternative was features that wait for their owners |
| Oct 28, 2026 | ProductionCostClose and CostingPolicies are built with Manufacturing's cost events, output receipt and run close. P13 seeds their GL account types and the scrap account, and P19's readiness checks the WIP and transfer accounts | The user's call |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Accounting is built after Products. It adds its context to Products' Supplier360 (P6), Product360 and InventoryValuation (P13), and uses P9's revaluation services and dialogs | The user's call |
| Oct 28, 2026 | The shared screens Accounting builds first carry the Accounting context only. Another app's context is added when that app is built | Follows from the above, as in Products |
| Oct 28, 2026 | The shared rules of impl-drawers-commons §4 apply: parties by role, and changes by effective date and the audit log. Here: SupplierProfile, InvoiceMatchPolicy, FixedAssetClass and BudgetControlPolicy are effective-dated rows with audit-logged key fields; budget amounts are audit-logged and a budget revision is a time; a sent invoice and an approved budget store their PDFs; a budget's other parties are BudgetParty rows. Mantle's existing audit-logged invoice, payment and transaction fields are kept | The user's call, in the Purchasing plan review (impl-purchasing §4) |
| Oct 28, 2026 | `import#Bill` takes a Purchasing buyer's upload as well as AP intake's (P6) | The user's call (impl-purchasing §4, answer 4); design-purchasing §1's AP-intake row was corrected in the Oct 28 design sweep |
| Oct 28, 2026 | The legacy match backfill is Accounting's (P7), run by AP or a buyer with the match group, from either app | The user's call (impl-purchasing §4, answer 5); it settles design-purchasing §18's migration item |
| Oct 28, 2026 | The supplier bill link is Purchasing's PO link, which Accounting adds in P18 with BillUpload (F44); with the move below it is the Supplier app's page for the PO, not a `/po/<token>` route | The user's call (impl-purchasing §4, answer 14) |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Public-facing applications are in mr-pass and internal ones in mr-boss. Accounting's customer and supplier pages are PASS apps: Billing with InvoicePay, and Supplier with BillUpload, which Purchasing P16 extends; not `screen/ServicePortal.xml` and `screen/SupplierPortal.xml` in BOSS. They follow PASS's foundation (§2): public accounts with no UserGroup, Mantle services through the facade for a local or remote authority, PASS invitations, media and request contract | The user's call, Oct 28, in the Customer Service plan review (impl-customer-service §4). It reverses crosscut D5's two BOSS roots; Customer Service's pages are its own PASS app, Support |
| Oct 28, 2026 | The root: `BOSS_ACCOUNTING` as root user group and artifact group. Its groups take `MANTLE_USER_ORG` and `MANTLE_PRIVATE_CONTACT`, and `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_ADMIN`, with all authz on the root, `MANTLE_ACTIVE_ORG` and `MANTLE_PRIVATE_CONTACT` (impl-drawers-commons §4). `AccessServices` checks every supplied organization and record. The records no filter covers (F5) are read only through services that check their parent's organization, and `GlAccount` stays global (F14) | The user's call (§5 review), for every BOSS root |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Each Mantle rule change is adopted by its own flag, off by default, so plain Mantle and its flow specs keep their behavior (F27). A flag lives with its owner's settings: Accounting's (D2's receipt billing, D3's pack invoice, D11's return settlement, D18's base-currency refusal, the hold guards) are audit-logged fields of `PartyAcctgPreference`, inherited as its other fields are; another app's are fields of its effective-dated policy rows (WarehousePolicy's expiry gate, ProductionPolicy's approver rule, the buying policy's approval gate, Customer Service's ServicePolicy). The names are neutral, since Mantle stands without BOSS (the Q2 row below). BOSS's demo organization turns them on; the organizations Mantle's specs use leave them off | The user's call (§5 review). The alternatives were one adoption flag on PartyAcctgPreference, and one PartySetting type. Superseded Oct 30: a flag only where a control breaks Mantle's flow specs (below) |
| Oct 28, 2026 | A posting-guard failure is split by source (F9, F10). A finance user's direct post (a manual entry, an invoice or payment post, a batch line) is refused with the reason. An automatic post from an operational event (a receipt, issue, shipment or production fact) goes to the error journal with the failed guard named; Accounting's MissingMappings and error-journal list and Today show it, and P11's close refuses a period that still holds one. An auto-poster that finds no account records a failure, not `AtrSuccess` | The user's call (§5 review). Design §15: a missing map blocks and is named, never a silent suspense. The alternatives were always refusing and always the error journal |
| Oct 28, 2026 | CX-POSTING keeps one Mantle operation record, keyed by `operationKey`, with the operation type, organization, user, time, request hash, preview version, status and links to the records it made or posted (F8). Each posting service checks and writes it in the posting's transaction: a retry with the same hash returns the stored result, and a different request under the same key is refused. Products' `ProductCatalogOperation` stays as built, for its resumable batches | The user's call (§5 review); a fact with an identity of its own under the shared rule. The alternative was an `operationKey` field on each target record. Warehouse, Manufacturing, Purchasing and Customer Service use the same record |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Lock scopes go by the transaction's source document. Sales: transactions whose invoice the organization issued (sales invoices, customer credits and returns, their adjustments). Purchases: those whose invoice it received. Tax: any transaction with an entry on a `GatTax` account, and `AttTaxDue` and `AttTaxInvoice`. All: every transaction, so payments, stock, depreciation and manual entries fall under it only. A hard lock takes no exception, and `TimePeriod.isClosed` still applies | The user's call (§5 review). Odoo's company lock dates, whose sale and purchase dates cover only those journals. The alternatives were an editable map of AcctgTrans types, and payments in the sales and purchase scopes |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Reports read closed periods' GL summary rows, which P11's close computes and stores, creating any that are missing (F16); open periods are summed from posted AcctgTransEntry rows at read time. `realTimeGlSummary` stays as each organization has it, and no report depends on it | The user's call (§5 review). The alternatives were requiring live summaries, which lock summary rows on each post, and recalculating before each report |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Exchange rates: P3 has manual dated UomConversion rates with a CSV import, each marked with its source. P20 builds `mantle.ledger.CurrencyServices.refresh#Rates` as a provider interface, a service name in a `PartyAcctgPreference` field, with the European Central Bank's daily reference rates as the shipped provider (free, no key; cross rates through EUR). A fetch proposes rates that a finance user accepts before they are active (AC-16) | The user's call (§5 review). Until P20 every document is in the base currency (D18). The alternatives were manual rates only, and the fetch at P3 |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Self-approval (design §1.1): one audit-logged `PartyAcctgPreference` field, off by default, which only `ACCOUNTING_ADMIN` sets (P1 grants it to `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_ADMIN`). It covers every Accounting approval (bills, invoices, journal entries, payment runs, write-offs), and a decision whose approver drafted the record is stamped self-approved, for the audit and the approvals report | The user's call (§5 review), as Products decided for estimates. The alternatives were a setting per document type, and none |
| Oct 28, 2026 | The payable hold guard is inside Mantle, at the one point where a payment is applied to a payable invoice, behind the hold flag. `PaymentApplyForInvoice` and `InvoiceApplyForPayments` catch its refusal and leave the payment unapplied with a named exception; `apply#Settlement`, `create#InvoicePayment`, `apply#InvoicePayment` and P8's runs meet the same check | The user's call (§5 review). Mantle reads its own InvoiceHold and never calls BOSS. The alternative was BOSS adapters with the SECAs conditioned, which leaves direct Mantle callers unguarded |
| Oct 28, 2026 | An app's Approvals list filters Commons Notifications by the approval topics it owns, passed by its mount; `get#UserNotifications` takes a list of topics (F43). Commons' own app chips stay. Purchasing (P4) and Customer Service (P9) mount theirs the same way | The user's call (§5 review). A bill approval stays in Accounting's list whichever app sent it. The alternative was the `appName` filter |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Payment terms (P8): `SettlementTermLine` (sequence, portion percent, days basis, discount percent, discount days) as effective-dated rows with audit-logged fields, saved through `store#SettlementTerm`; a per-invoice `InvoiceDueSchedule` (due date, amount, discount date, discount amount) written at issue, the invoice's own audit-logged rows, so a later term change never alters an issued invoice. Aging, PayablesWorkbench, PaymentRunDetail and `apply#Settlement` read it, and a discount taken within its date posts to the discount account, for customer receipts and supplier payments | The user's call (§5 review): design §20's recommendation, with dated rows in place of its versions. The alternatives were a single discount on SettlementTerm, and due terms only |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Accounting builds project cost posting (P11; F45): `post#WorkEffortCost` reclasses a project's approved time at the entry's cost rate, debiting project cost and crediting a labor clearing account (both GL account types seeded, mapped in PostingDefaults), with the project on the transaction. It runs on timesheet approval behind its own flag, keyed by time entry on the operation record, and posts a dated reversing delta when the approval is undone or the entry changes. Production time is excluded, since Manufacturing's labor events post it (D12) | The user's call (§5 review). impl-projects §7 handed it to Accounting. The alternative was §7, with the People app's payroll; payroll then credits the clearing account rather than wage expense, which the organization's setup decides |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Product360's Accounting context gains a GL mappings pane over `ProductGlAccount` and `ProductCategoryGlAccount` (P13), organization-scoped and edited by finance admin; PostingDefaults stays the bulk editor, and the Products context does not show it | The user's call (§5 review): design §20's recommendation. It is in crosscut §3.5 since the Oct 28 design sweep. The alternative was PostingDefaults only |
| Oct 28, 2026 | The pack invoice (F25), behind D3's flag: the pack SECA creates the sales invoice InvoiceInProcess, without applying payments, and a ShipShipped SECA finalizes it (posting it, applying captured payments and sending it). Between pack and ship, Warehouse's Reopen package and put-back and Customer Service's `apply#OrderChange` call `release#ShipmentDraftInvoice` as D3 designs; after ship, changes go through returns and credit memos. With the flag off Mantle finalizes at pack as before, so OrderToCashBasicFlow passes unchanged | The user's call (§5 review). Revenue and receivable then come at shipment. The alternative was finalizing at pack and building InvoiceCorrection for every change after it. Design-accounting §14 (D3) and crosscut §3.8 were corrected in the Oct 28 design sweep; Warehouse P12 and Customer Service P10 follow |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Chart templates (P19; F14) are seeded template organizations on Mantle's one global chart: a Party with no transactions, holding its account links, type defaults and mappings, copied into a new organization by Mantle's `init#PartyAccountingConfiguration` (`sourcePartyId`). The first release ships one template, from Mantle's installed chart; country charts whose codes conflict are §7's country packs | The user's call (§5 review), Mantle's existing setup copy. The alternatives were template records applied by a BOSS service, and account codes unique per organization |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Two apps by owner and audience, Billing for customers and Supplier for suppliers, rather than one customer app with Customer Service's Support | The plan's choice: P18 comes before Customer Service, and PASS shares accounts and navigation across a site's apps (design-forum §13.1) |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Mantle stands without BOSS, and business logic leans to Mantle. mr-mantle has no dependency on mr-boss: no Mantle service, SECA, EECA, script, data file or spec calls `ironstone.*`, reads a BOSS screen, entity or setting, or names a BOSS group; Mantle checks Moqui permissions, which BOSS grants its groups. Logic not specific to one screen goes in Mantle, in the package of its records, and an `ironstone.accounting` service keeps the capability check, a screen's reads, shapes and saved views, the settings forms and the call to Mantle (§2). So Accounting's services move: to `mantle.ledger` the close and locks, journals, setup, period runs, rates, the production cost close, and the asset books beside Products P9's revaluation; to `mantle.account` invoice states, sending, batches, intake, holds and terms (InvoiceServices), settlement, payment states, transfers, deposits and refunds (PaymentServices), statement import and reconciliation (ReconciliationServices), and the new InvoiceMatchServices, PaymentRunServices, CreditServices, CollectionServices and RecurringInvoiceServices; to `mantle.other` tax and budgets; to `mantle.order.ReturnServices` the return settlement; to `mantle.party.SupplierServices` the supplier profile; and the report runs to Mantle's ledger, inventory and sales report files. BOSS keeps AccessServices, HomeServices, DocumentServices, ReportServices' catalog and shapes, and the list reads (`find#BillExceptions`, `find#Runs`, `find#Work` and the like). P1 grants Accounting's groups the new `RECEIVABLE_EDIT`, `PAYABLE_EDIT`, `PAYABLE_IMPORT`, `INVOICE_HOLD`, `INVOICE_HOLD_RELEASE`, `INVOICE_MATCH`, `PAYMENT_EDIT`, `BANK_RECONCILE`, `PAYMENT_RUN_APPROVE`, `FISCAL_CLOSE`, `CREDIT_HOLD_RELEASE`, `CUSTOMER_CREDIT_VIEW`, `TAX_STATEMENT_EDIT`, `BUDGET_EDIT`, `BUDGET_OVERRIDE`, `RETURN_CREDIT_APPROVE`, `PRODUCTION_COST_POST`, `SUPPLIER_TERMS_EDIT` and `ACCOUNTING_ADMIN`, with Mantle's `INVOICE_APPROVE` and `FISCAL_REOPEN` and Products' `ACCOUNTING_VIEW`, `ACCOUNTING_GL_POST` and `PRODUCT_COST_VIEW`, and `RECEIVABLE_EDIT` to `BOSS_PROJECT_MANAGER` for Projects' Billing; none gets `GL_POST_CLOSED` | The user's call (plan review Q2): a hard rule for every app, in impl-drawers-commons §4. It replaces §2's guarded `ironstone.accounting` adapters. The owner designs' names follow in the design sweep |
| Oct 28, 2026 | Revaluation changes forward cost (AC-07, built by Products P9; used in P13). `mantle.ledger.AssetBookServices.post#Revaluation`, a new Mantle service behind its own flag (`PartyAcctgPreference.inventoryRevaluationEnabled`), off by default and tested in both states, sets `Asset.acquireCost` on the on-hand assets from the effective date, without reposting history, splitting a partly issued asset. It posts one AcctgTrans for on-hand × delta, with asset links, against the seeded offset type `GatInventoryRevaluation`, which P3's PostingDefaults maps. It refuses negative on-hand, a date before the product's last posted movement and a future date, and never calls `update#ProductAcquireCost`. Later issues then post at the new cost, and P13's valuation and inventory account agree after a revaluation | The user's call (plan review Q7), as ERPNext and Odoo do. It replaces "value only", which stranded the amount in the inventory account; design-accounting's AC-07 follows in the design sweep |
| Oct 30, 2026 | P4–P5 are rebased on Mantle's services, and what they built beside them is deleted: gateway actions through the `*#SinglePayment` services, refunds through `create#RefundPayment`, applications through the `apply#*` services, state changes through `update#Payment`, a transfer as one payment that `post#Payment` posts, and invoice print, email, statements and credit memos through Mantle's services and templates (R2; F115) | The user's call (R2). The alternative was correcting the copies in place |
| Oct 30, 2026 | The adoption flags are retired: a new control is the one behavior (§2). Retired: `invoiceHoldGuardEnabled` (P6 builds the hold), `paymentGatewayWorkflowEnabled`, `settlementApplicationGuardEnabled` and `paymentAutoApplicationEnabled`. `postingGuardEnabled` stays, off by default, and BOSS's demo organization turns it on: it gates the posting guard and the invoice and payment `MAPPING_MISSING` refusal, because turning them on breaks Mantle's OrderToCash, ProcureToPay, ReturnToResponse, InvoicePaymentMisc and Payroll flow specs (their demo account assignments, and the error journal those flows post to). An invoice's book day and drafter, the settlement rules, and the invoice period and posted-state refusals hold whatever it says. P2's `requiredLedgerDimensionsEnabled` and `forwardIssuanceRepostEnabled` stay as P2 built them; R2 did not reexamine them. `singleCurrencyDocumentsOnly` (D18) and `invoiceApprovalRequired` are the organization's settings, not a switch between old and new code. D2's, D3's and D11's rule changes, which change what Mantle's flow specs assert (F27), get flags when built | The user's call (R2). It supersedes the Oct 28 flag row |
| Oct 30, 2026 | No screenshot specs in any component; a walk asserts what a page shows. Service implementations are inline XML Actions, with JavaScript modules only for logic XML Actions do not express well (docs/dev/Practices-App-Dev.md) | The user's call (R2) |
| Oct 31, 2026 | D2's receipt billing is behind `PartyAcctgPreference.receiptInvoiceSelfBilledOnly`, off by default: with it on, `ShipmentIncomingDeliveredCreateInvoices` bills a delivered receipt only for a self-billing supplier (its SupplierProfile in effect), with `acceptedOnly`. OrderProcureToPayBasicFlow asserts the SECA's bill with its freight line, so the rule is a flag; BOSS's demo organization turns it on. The hold guard has no flag (no flow spec holds a bill): it is in `change#InvoiceState`'s approval of a bill, the application rules (`apply#InvoicePayment`, `apply#InvoiceToInvoice`, `apply#Settlement`), `create#InvoicePayment` and the open items, and `apply#PaymentForInvoice` and `apply#InvoiceForPayments` leave a held bill's payment unapplied with a `PAYMENT_HELD` warning | §2's flag rule (the Oct 30 row) |
| Oct 31, 2026 | `mantle.account.InvoiceServices.request#PayableApproval` (`PAYABLE_EDIT`) receives an incoming bill and sends the `BillApproval` notification; the plan named only `approve#Payable` and no sender of the topic (agent's call, for review) | The alternative was a SECA on the receive, a hot path the rules keep free |
| Oct 31, 2026 | Accounting's supplier context is its own `Accounting/Payables/Supplier360`, on Customer360's pattern, not Products' `Shared/Supplier360` with an Accounting branch (F135). Its finance details are Customer360's, one template (`template/AccountingFinanceDetails.xml`), writing through Mantle's `CustomerFinanceServices` writers with `side` supplier; the side counts only that side's relationship (a supplier's bills, purchase orders or profile), and the side's permission follows from it (agent's call, for review) | A single Supplier360 with per-app tabs waits for a way to vary a shared screen's tabs by mount; the coordinator raised it with the user |
| Oct 31, 2026 | Approvals is the Commons Notifications list mounted with Accounting's approval topics (`notificationTopics`, through the framework's `get#UserNotifications` `topicList`), as F43 and the Oct 28 row decided; a row opens its bill and nothing is decided from the list. `approve#Payable` and `release#InvoiceHold` mark their notifications read, and `request#PayableApproval` and `request#HoldRelease` notify only the organization's users who hold the deciding permission. `Shared/OrderDetail`'s Accounting context is a branch of that screen with boxes (Items, Invoices and payments, Fulfillment, History) rather than tabs, since it has none; `Shared/ShipmentDetail` is new with the Accounting context only (agent's call, for review) | Commons Notifications takes `appName`, not topics, and the framework service one topic |
| Oct 31, 2026 | The match exception hold (`IhrMatchException`) is placed by the match itself, in `apply#InvoiceMatch` and the re-evaluation job, as an `InvoiceHold` row like `hold#Invoice`'s, not through `hold#Invoice`'s `INVOICE_HOLD` check: a match operator (a buyer with the match group) holds no `INVOICE_HOLD`, and a scheduled job runs with no user (F151). Its placer is the user who applied the match (none for the job), so an approver who did not apply it releases it (agent's call, for review) | The alternative was granting the match group `INVOICE_HOLD`, which would let buyers place any hold, and a run-as user for the job |
| Oct 31, 2026 | BillDetail's Match tab is `Shared/InvoiceMatch` itself (one route, `Payables/BillDetail/Match`), not a separate `Payables/InvoiceMatch` route; the legacy backfill is its own task screen, `Payables/LegacyMatches`, linked from MatchPolicies, since Settings is the finance administrator's alone and AP and match operators run the backfill (F152). The match group (`BOSS_ACCOUNTING_MATCH`) gets `PAYABLE_VIEW` and the Payables screens, to read the bills it matches (F153) (agent's call, for review) | The alternatives were opening Settings to AP and the match group, and a match screen beside BillDetail |
| Oct 31, 2026 | Match policy (agent's call, for review): with no row in effect a bill matches accepted receipts with no tolerance and a variance holds the bill; a tolerance is the larger of a percent and a fixed allowance; the design's "same-rate action (Warn or Stop)" is the action outside tolerance (`ImaHold`, `ImaWarn`); tax tolerance and the service-acceptance rule wait for their checks (§7). An unmatched quantity, a product line with no source and a missing receipt where required are exceptions that hold, like a price variance; quantity beyond what the source allows is refused at apply. A re-evaluation uses the policy rows the match lines kept | Design §15 MatchPolicies lists the fields without their semantics |
| Oct 31, 2026 | BankRules is `Accounting/Banking/BankRules`, not under Settings: Settings is finance-admin only by artifact authorization, and the design gives the rules to treasury too. Design §2 and §15 follow | P9 (agent's call, for review). The alternative was a treasury grant on the Settings section, which opens its other settings screens to treasury |
| Oct 31, 2026 | A statement session (`BankReconciliation`) links the bank lines of its period through `BankReconciliationLine`, keyed by the bank line, so one session clears a line; the sessions of one bank never overlap; finishing needs every line of the period cleared, each matched or not reconciled with a reason, and a zero difference. A rejected or missing statement row shows as a difference until it is added or the closing balance corrected, so finishing needs no separate resolution of import rejections. Reopening a finished statement is later (§7) | P9 (agent's call, for review): design §7 ReconciliationDetail's "resolved import errors" and its finance-admin reopen |
| Oct 31, 2026 | Reading bank lines needs `BANK_RECONCILE`, `ACCOUNTING_VIEW` or `ACCOUNTING_ADMIN`, not `PAYMENT_VIEW` alone, so AR does not read bank statements; changing them needs `BANK_RECONCILE`; a deposit slip needs `PAYMENT_EDIT` with `PAYMENT_VIEW`. Banking opens for treasury, the reader and the finance admin. `AccountingPolicy.capabilities` gains `bankReconcile`, which is not a general finance read: it opens only a scope that names it (`organization(p, "bankReconcile")`), so a user holding only `BANK_RECONCILE` reads banks and nothing else of Accounting | P9 (agent's call, for review; narrowed after the P9 review) |
| Oct 31, 2026 | Statements follow one another: a new session starts the day after the bank's previous one ends, only once that one is finished, and none starts before an existing one; its opening balance is the previous closing balance. No line is added, imported or moved into a finished statement's period (`check#BankLineDay`), and a finished statement's lines do not change (`check#BankLineOpen`, also in `update#PaymentMethodTrans`) | P9 review B3 and B4 (agent's call, for review). The alternative was re-deriving the opening at finish |
| Oct 31, 2026 | A finance user's own stored-value movement goes through `FinancialAccountServices.record#FinancialAccountMovement`, which refuses and rolls back a movement whose transaction does not post (as §4 Oct 28 refuses a finance user's direct post); `deposit#`, `withdraw#` and `adjust#FinancialAccount`, which orders, payments and gift cards call, keep the automatic posting to the error journal | P9 review B1: an explicit service, no caller-name check |
| Oct 31, 2026 | `clear#PaymentTrans`, which the PaymentCancelClearMethodTrans SECA runs on a cancelled or voided payment, is refused when the payment is on a line a finished statement cleared (BANK_LINE_FINISHED), so the void fails until the statement is dealt with. This is a new refusal on Mantle's void flow (§2) | P9 review; reopening a statement is §7 |
| Oct 31, 2026 | A deposit slip groups delivered receipts whose `toPaymentMethodId` is the bank account, in its currency, so the cash is already booked to the bank's account and the deposit changes no posting. A receipt recorded without a bank method (posted to an undeposited-funds account) is not offered (§7) | P9 (agent's call, for review): R-ACC-33 groups "receipts of one bank account" |
| Oct 31, 2026 | The existing `create#`, `update#`, `reconcile#`, `unreconcile#`, `noReconcile#PaymentMethodTrans` and `match#PaymentMethodTransUnmatched` check no permission, since the statement message consumers call them; screens call `check#BankAccess` first, and the new services check it themselves. `reconcile#`, `unreconcile#` and `noReconcile#` refuse a line a finished session cleared, and `match#` reconciles only a line with one possible match (F192) | P9, a new refusal in existing Mantle services (§2) |
| Oct 31, 2026 | P14: an organization's sales tax gateway for its invoices without a store, or whose store has none, is `PartyAcctgPreference.taxGatewayConfigId` (audit-logged); a store's own binding comes first. The local gateway taxes a sale where the organization (or one it rolls up to) has nexus (`TaxAuthorityParty.isNexus`) and a sales tax rate, for each authority whose geo is the destination's country, state, county, city or postal code; the destination is the customer's shipping, else billing, else primary address. An organization with no sales tax nexus gets no tax, so Mantle's order flows are unchanged | Agent's call, for review. Destination-based only; origin sourcing, tax-inclusive prices and VAT are §7. The alternative for the organization's gateway was a PartySetting |
| Oct 31, 2026 | P14: a sales invoice's tax is calculated when it is finalized or approved, inside `change#InvoiceState`, and the result is written only when it differs, so an approved version keeps its fingerprint; a tax refusal refuses the state change. Back in draft, the calculated lines are removed | Agent's call, for review. The alternative was calculating on each draft edit, which touches `store#InvoiceDraftItem` (P6 edits it) and every line change; a "Calculate tax" action on the draft is §5 |
| Oct 31, 2026 | P14: a rate version is a dated `TaxAuthorityRate` row of the organization; `store#Rate` starts a new version and ends the one it replaces, or ends one, and refuses overlaps of one authority, type and scope; an invoice tax line keeps its version (`InvoiceItem.taxAuthorityRateId`) with its base, rate and rounding | Agent's call, for review; the shared rule of changes by effective date. The design's "priority" is the scope's specificity (category, store, organization) |
| Oct 31, 2026 | P14: the 1099 run (`run#Vendor1099Statements`) reports the vendors the organization paid in the year who are registered with the IRS and not exempt (`TaxAuthorityParty` for `UsaIrs`, the TaxRegistrations form), from the year's payments applied to their invoices, split by item type in proportion. `create#AllVendor1099MiscStatements` stays as it was for its callers; `create#Vendor1099MiscStatement` takes the run's `itemTypeTotals` | Agent's call, for review (F41, F294). The alternatives were every vendor over the threshold (Mantle's), and an eligibility field on Party |
| Oct 31, 2026 | P14: a statement's export is CSV data with a format version (`local-sales-tax-v1`, `usa-1099-misc-data-v1`), recorded on the statement; an exported statement is kept, and a change to its sources is a new statement for the period. No authority filing format ships (design §20) | Agent's call, for review |

## 5. Open questions

| Question | Decides | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Further issues discovered during implementation | the affected phase | Record findings and decisions here; the open questions of the plan as written are decided in §4 |
| Should a draft invoice show its sales tax before it is finalized (a Calculate tax action, or a calculation on each line change)? | P14 follow-up, with P6 (`store#InvoiceDraftItem`) | P14 calculates at finalize or approve only (§4) |

The design's other §20 items are `later` there and in §7.

## 6. Findings

Design assumptions found wrong or unstated in the code, with the resolution. Where a resolution changes the
design, it is written there too. R2 deleted much of what P4–P5 built: where a resolution of F78–F112 describes
that code (the archive, Drive and source guards, the legacy fence, the gateway attempts and reservations, the
adoption flags), F115–F126 and R2 say what stands.

| # | Finding | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| F1 | P0: `screen/Accounting/` has nine placeholders: Home, Receivables, Payables, Banking, GeneralLedger, Tax, Budgets, Reports and Settings. There are no Payments, PeriodClose, FixedAssets, Inventory, Records or Approvals areas, and the root has no `<shell-providers>`. The `BOSS_ACCOUNTING` authz is in BossSetupData's commented not-yet-implemented block | P1 |
| F2 | P0: `Shared/InvoiceDetail` and `Shared/OrderDetail` are mounted by Projects only and do not branch on `appRoot`. InvoiceDetail's `invoices` transition, its print and PDF URLs and its email attachment name Projects' screens. Projects' `update#InvoiceStatus` covers client invoices only; its `send#Invoice` approves a draft, sends the `BOSS_PROJECT_INVOICE` template with the PDF and marks the invoice Sent | P4 adds the context on `Shared/RequestDetail`'s pattern and a shared invoice print; Projects' services call Accounting's |
| F3 | P0: AppStructure's non-placeholder list is fixed at Commons, Comms, Insights and Projects, and its placeholder floor is 97 | P1 adds Accounting and lowers the floor |
| F4 | P0: BOSS has no Customer360, Supplier360, ShipmentDetail, ReturnDetail, EquipmentDetail, Product360, InventoryValuation or Approvals screen. Products builds Product360 (its P2), Supplier360 (P6) and InventoryValuation's two dialogs (P9) | Accounting builds the rest with its context (§2); it extends Products' |
| F5 | P0: `MANTLE_USER_ORG` and `MANTLE_ACTIVE_ORG` filter Invoice and Payment (from or to party), AcctgTrans and FinancialAccount (organization), TimePeriod, ReturnHeader, Shipment and OrderPart. Nothing filters InvoiceItem, PaymentApplication, AcctgTransEntry, GlAccount, GlAccountOrganization, PaymentMethod, PaymentMethodTrans, Budget, TaxStatement or Asset | Those are read through services that check the organization (§2); the root's filters are the organization filters (§4) |
| F6 | P0: Mantle's ledger report services check no access. `get#GlAccountClassReportInfo` filters by period only, not by organization; `get#SalesTopProduct` and `get#InvoicesByCustomerClass` take no organization; the ledger reports are on Mantle REST | P1 grants no REST ledger path; P16's report runs in Mantle check the organization and its periods |
| F7 | P0: the demo runs `init#PartyAccountingConfiguration` for `ORG_ZIZI_CORP` (with `realTimeGlSummary=Y`); `ORG_ZIZI_RETAIL` has no preference of its own and inherits through its rollup. Periods exist only for the load year and the next, and no accounting transactions are seeded | P1's demo data builds on it and runs its postings through a demo service |
| F8 | P0: the framework has no operation-key helper (only AgentRun's `clientRequestId`); payments have no idempotency key, `paymentRefNum` is not unique, and `create#InvoicePayment`'s only duplicate guard is a covered total | One operation record (§4); P5 is the first heavy user |
| F9 | P0: `post#AcctgTrans` checks the balance, `disallowPosting`, the scheduled date and every fiscal period of the date for `isClosed` (bypassed by `forcePost` with `GL_POST_CLOSED`), and diverts failures to the error journal. It checks no organization, currency or lock date, and `verifyOnly` already moves a failed transaction to the error journal | P2a adds the guard and fixes `verifyOnly`; no BOSS group gets `GL_POST_CLOSED`; a failure is refused or goes to the error journal by its source (§4) |
| F10 | P0: an auto-poster that finds no GL account sets the error journal itself, without calling `post#AcctgTrans`, and still records `AtrSuccess` on a stock movement | P3's MissingMappings and P11's checklist list the error-journal transactions; P13 lists the movements |
| F11 | P0: `update#AcctgTransPosted` checks nothing and can change a posted transaction's organization or type. `unpost#AcctgTrans` and every `repost#*` (invoices, payments, receipts, issuances, variances, assets) unpost and hard-delete the posted transaction, so each fails in a closed period. `AssetIssuanceGlRePost` runs on any AssetIssuance update | No BOSS group is granted them (P1); P2a's `update#PostedMetadata` and `repost#AssetIssuance` delta |
| F12 | P0: `post#ReverseAcctgTrans` keeps the original's transaction date, and marks the original reversed even when the reversal lands in the error journal | P2a adds a reversal date (Mantle's default unchanged) and marks only a posted reversal |
| F13 | P0: `check#NextFiscalTimePeriods` assumes a calendar fiscal year; `fiscalYearStartMonth` and `fiscalYearStartDay` are read nowhere. `get#OrganizationFiscalTimePeriods` creates periods when it finds none | P2a follows the organization's start; P19's Setup sets it |
| F14 | P0: GlAccount is global, with a unique digits-only `accountCode`. `GlAccountOrganization` has no dates or active flag. `set#GlAccountFlags` always overwrites `isDebit` and `isTemporary` | P2a adds the dates; chart templates are template organizations (§4, P19) |
| F15 | P0: `AcctgTransEntry` has `productId` and `assetId` but no facility or cost centre; `AcctgTrans.workEffortId` is never set by an auto-poster; the `COST_CENTER` GL account category type exists and is unused | P2b and P6 add the dimensions; the cost centre stays a Party (design AC-22) |
| F16 | P0: `GlAccountOrgTimePeriod` has no currency and is kept live only with `realTimeGlSummary=Y`; `recalculate#GlAccountOrgTimePeriodAmounts` fixes existing rows and creates none | Closed periods' rows and open periods' live sums (§4); P20 keeps one currency per summary |
| F17 | P0: `post#GlJournal` returns on a raised error, but a transaction diverted to the error journal raises none and is counted as posted, and `closeJournal` marks the journal posted regardless. The design says it stops at the first error | P2b's `post#Batch`; design §8 JournalBatches corrected |
| F18 | P0: there is no guarded invoice transition. Status changes are `update#Invoice` against the status flows, with `INVOICE_APPROVE` enforced by the framework; `unapply#PaymentApplication` changes an invoice's status by a direct update | P4's `mantle.account.InvoiceServices.change#InvoiceState`; unapply runs through it |
| F19 | P0: Mantle converts no currency. Every poster writes the document's currency as the transaction's, the GL summaries add currencies together, the original and local currency fields are never filled, `post#PaymentApplication` books no FX, and `GatForExGain` and `GatForExLoss` exist with no default mapping. `get#ReceivableStatementInfo` mixes currencies | P4's refusal (D18), statements by currency; P20 |
| F20 | P0: `moqui.basic.UomConversion.conversionFactor` is a float; no currency rates are seeded and Mantle reads none | P3's Currencies; P20 stores the decimal rate on the document and the transaction |
| F21 | P0: `send#InvoiceStoreEmail` needs a ProductStore and its email template, returns silently without one, and sets the invoice Sent | P4's `send#Invoice` |
| F22 | P0: `create#InvoiceCreditMemo` makes one reversed-party item, not linked to the original or applied to it; `reverse#Invoice` refuses an invoice with applications | P4 links and applies the credit memo |
| F23 | P0: Mantle's write-off status is reached only from Payment Received, which a SECA refuses while anything is unpaid; there is no payable write-off | P5's write-off is a posted adjustment to its account |
| F24 | P0: `autoApply#Payment` and `autoApplyTo#Invoice` are empty stubs (Remaining-Work lists the first) | P5 implements `autoApply#Payment` |
| F25 | P0: the pack SECA calls `create#SalesShipmentInvoices` with `applyPayments` defaulting to true, which finalizes the invoice, and so posts it, at pack. D3's `release#ShipmentDraftInvoice` assumes it is still in process | Behind D3's flag the invoice is finalized at ship (§4, P17) |
| F26 | P0: `create#PurchaseShipmentInvoices` bills each receipt's accepted quantity, then a leftover line with no asset for what was shipped and not accepted, and every non-product order line in full on the first shipment's invoice. It has no `acceptedOnly` | P6 adds `acceptedOnly` |
| F27 | P0: Mantle's flow specs assert the behaviors D2, D3 and D11 change: OrderProcureToPayBasicFlow the SECA's purchase invoice with its freight line, OrderToCashBasicFlow the pack invoice paid, ReturnToResponseBasicFlow the responses. Six specs assert posted amounts | Each change sits behind its own flag, off by default (§2, §4); the specs pass unchanged |
| F28 | P0: the due date is set by the `InvoiceSetDueDate` EECA: the invoice's term, else the newest agreement term, else PartyAcctgPreference's for a receivable only | P6 adds SupplierProfile's term for a bill |
| F29 | P0: there is no SupplierProfile, no OrderHoldReason (OrderHold is only an order status) and no external access capability; the nearest are the unsubscribe tokens and the forum's access grants | P6, P10 and P18, under the owners' names (§4) |
| F30 | P0: `update#BankAccount` copies a non-internal owner's bank account to a new payment method and expires the old one | P8's approval void keys on the supplier |
| F31 | P0: there is no internal-transfer payment type; `Payment.toPaymentMethodId` exists | P5 seeds `PtInternalTransfer` |
| F32 | P0: `import#NachaReturn` sets a delivered payment Declined; nothing reverses its posting or unapplies it | P8 |
| F33 | P0: BAI2 has no transaction id, so `upload#BaiVersion2` numbers lines from a sequence and a re-import duplicates them; OFX skips a known FIT id. `PaymentMethodTrans` has no currency or statement id. `match#PaymentMethodTransUnmatched` takes the first match. `GlReconciliation` is used by no service | P9's line identity, sessions and rules; GlReconciliation stays out (design §18.2) |
| F34 | P0: `check#OrderPreApprove` answers `approveWarnings`, which a post SECA can add to; `autoApprove#Order` approves only with no warnings and payments covering the total | P10 as designed |
| F35 | P0: `process#ReturnItemResponses` returns without responding for a purchase return (customer is an internal organization). `ReturnApprovedProcess` runs it at approval for immediate-response items. `ReturnItemBilling.assetReceiptId` is never filled | P17: the supplier branch is new code; settlement fills the receipt |
| F36 | P0: `InvoiceAgingSummary` buckets against today, with no as-of date. Its H2 expression has the opposite sign of the others, a 121-day-old invoice falls in no bucket, and its role joins can multiply sums | P10's `run#Aging` takes the as-of date; the view is fixed in Mantle |
| F37 | P0: `close#FinancialTimePeriod` counts every organization's unposted transactions and creates no closing entries; `create#PeriodCloseAcctgTrans` takes the first NET_INCOME account of the chart; `reopen#FinancialTimePeriod` ignores a closed parent | P11 |
| F38 | P0: depreciation needs a type, cost, acquired date and expected end of life; useful life is whole years between the dates; units of production is a TODO; `post#FixedAssetDepreciation` writes the depreciation row and accumulated amount even when the transaction went to the error journal; `calculateAndPost#AllFixedAssetDepreciations` dates a day early. Asset classes are an enumeration | P12 |
| F39 | P0: `update#AssetAcquireCost` calls `repost#Asset`, which deletes and re-posts every receipt, issuance and variance transaction of the asset and fails in a closed period; `update#ProductAcquireCost` loops it | Finance-admin data repair only, in an open period (P12, P13) |
| F40 | P0: `AssetValuationSummary` values on-hand quantity at each asset's current cost, not from the GL. A zero-cost receipt posts zero. `cogsMethodEnumId` is read by no service: posting is always actual cost. There is no scrap account. An issuance to a work effort another party owns posts to COGS | P13 sets the valuation beside the accounts and lists the exceptions; P3 shows the COGS method as it is; design §10 and §18.2 corrected |
| F41 | P0: `TaxAuthorityRate` is commented out, its relationship keyed by a composite that is not TaxAuthority's key. `calculate#SalesTaxLocal` only logs; `calculate#InvoiceSalesTax` is empty. Tax lines post through `ItemTypeGlAccount`; `TaxAuthorityGlAccount` is unused. `ItemVatTax` is not left out of totals. The 1099 selection is by invoice date over 600, with no eligibility flag | P14 |
| F42 | P0: Budget has no organization (its period's party is), and its status type has no items or transitions. Sub-period entry covers twelve periods. `run#BudgetExpenseReport`'s actual is posted debits of expense accounts only; the detail report is invoice-based. No budget service checks status or permission | P15 |
| F43 | P0: approvals are NotificationTopics with approve and refuse services; there is no provider registry. Commons Notifications filters by `appName` | P6's mount, filtered by topic list (§4) |
| F44 | P0: MoquiConf `<token-route>` is generic: a token service answers `valid` and a route context, and the screen gets the token. Crosscut §5 names `/pay` for InvoicePay and no route for bill upload | P18. The customer and supplier links are pages of the PASS apps taking their tokens, not `<token-route>`s (§4); the bill link is the PO's (§4) |
| F45 | P0: impl-projects §7 hands project cost posting (`post#WorkEffortCost`, an empty stub) and a link to Mantle budgets to Accounting; design-accounting names neither | P11 builds the posting (§4); the budget link is §7 |
| F46 | P0: Projects' invoices check no currency (impl-projects F91), and its approve finalizes and posts | P4's `change#InvoiceState` applies D18 to them too |
| F47 | P0, Products' state: Products P9 (mr-mantle 5a18970e, mr-boss 2a4abd6) built parts this plan proposes. `mantle.ledger.transaction.PostingOperation` is §4's CX-POSTING record (key, type, organization, user, request hash, preview fingerprint, status, result). `mantle.product.asset.AssetBookEvent` is create-only, with ledger and reversal links. `mantle.ledger.AssetBookServices` holds the revaluation, behind `PartyAcctgPreference.inventoryRevaluationEnabled`, posting `AttInventoryRevaluation` against `GatInventoryRevaluation`, read from `GlAccountTypeDefault` and mapped only for `ORG_ZIZI_SERVICES` in BOSS's Products demo. BOSS's `ironstone.accounting.AssetBookServices` passes its four services through to Mantle's, and InventoryValuation's dialogs call those | P2a and P5 post through PostingOperation; P12 adds its event types to AssetBookEvent and its services to AssetBookServices; P3 maps the offset type for Accounting's demo organization. The dialogs call Mantle directly, and BOSS keeps only `get#RevaluationContext` (Products' fix) |

| F48 | P0 Oct 29: `mantle.rest.xml` exposes invoice and payment create/update/apply/cancel/gateway operations and GL create/update/delete/post/reverse/period mutators. Accounting root authorization does not grant the REST screen. | AccountingAccess exercises REST with authorization enabled; no Accounting REST grant is added. |
| F49 | P0 Oct 29: `MantleInvoice` exists in MantleDocumentData; payment, GL account and accounting transaction documents do not. | P1 adds the three documents and access-checked palette sources. Global accounts are visible only through an authorized organization's assignment. |
| F50 | P0 Oct 29: there is no inspection quantity model or source-inspection service in Mantle. | P7 must not invent a successful zero-inspection result: CX-QUALITY is a future owner contract, with received/accepted quantity as existing evidence and an explicit unavailable inspection check. |
| F51 | P0 Oct 29: AccountConfigData installs TEST_APPROVE and TEST_DECLINE; PaymentTestServices also has card/expiry/NSF failures, but no durable pending-provider fixture. | P18 adds a deterministic pending/completion fixture; no gateway runtime change in P0–P3. |
| F52 | P0 Oct 29: PublicSiteApp has targetId, but Forum's mount writer accepts only forum/account/members/sites and does not persist targetId. Readiness and URL builders are Forum-specific. PASS uses Schema/Routes and Mantle PassRoutes allowlists; invitations bind a verified recipient, not employee groups. Media is staged/scanned before record finalization. | P18 adds Billing/Supplier mounts, typed organization targets, operation schemas, readiness, record finalizers and canonical page URL builders; its contract is recorded in mr-pass/design-forum. |
| F53 | P0 Oct 29: Pass.xml has form-action self and frame-ancestors none. Hosted gateway form posts therefore need a reviewed provider-specific policy; return URLs must remain local validated paths. | P18 retains the CSP by default and tests hosted redirect, pending and decline paths without arbitrary return URLs. |
| F54 | P0 Oct 29: Products' Product360, Supplier360, standard costs, PostingOperation and native forward revaluation exist. Its old BOSS AssetBook wrappers still exist in this checkout. | Reuse native operations and the shared posting record; extend the Accounting contexts in their assigned later phases. |
| F55 | P0 Oct 29: move#AcctgTransEntry refuses drafts and creates a correction transaction for posted entries. | P2 adds move#DraftLine; the draft editor must not expose the posted adjustment primitive. |

| F56 | P2: PostingOperation keys are existing 40-character identifiers. | Reviewed external keys are bounded at 40; derived batch/source identities use deterministic hashes that fit the existing record. No parallel operation table was introduced. |
| F57 | P2: invoice/payment missing-mapping branches bypassed post#AcctgTrans; operational posters could set AtrSuccess without a posted transaction. | Adopted direct financial posts refuse missing mappings atomically. Adopted stock/financial-account sources retain the unposted error journal and AtrPostingFailed, with a stable failure code. Legacy defaults remain unchanged. |
| F58 | P3: invoice item enums use ItemType; variance reasons use InventoryVarianceReason. Product invoice mapping resolves category before product, then asset-type and item defaults. | Server choices and mapping-precedence text use the installed native contracts; missing item defaults are checked through get#InvoiceItemGlAccount. |
| F59 | P3: PaymentGatewayConfig is global and contains executable service names. | PaymentGatewayOrganization is an audited external provisioning boundary. Finance returns only active organization-permitted gateway IDs/descriptions, and no credentials or executable fields. Existing method identifiers remain masked. |
| F60 | P3 browser verification: the remote choice widget discarded loaded options when a parent form rerendered its empty seed array, then cleared a selection outside the first search page. | The existing widget preserves the loaded selection across renders/search pages; a changed dependency still clears it. QvtKeys and the Accounting mapping-repair walk exercise the contract. |

| F61 | Review Oct 29: Home's and the Settings screens' Choose organization form posted to `selectOrganization`, which no screen had: a `transition-include` copies one named transition, and only `choices` was included | Each screen includes both; AccountingShell posts the picker on Home and Settings |
| F62 | Review: deleting a draft went back to JournalEntries with the deleted id, which the list declared as a parameter and filtered by, so the list was empty | The list declares only what it reads; a spec checks the response's Location |
| F63 | Review: Accounting's choices searched case-sensitively, ignored the term for journals, batches, templates, locks, periods, users and groups, and filtered in JavaScript after `limit`; the `parties` choice called `makeCondition(field, value)`, which this framework reads as field and operator, so the new-document Customer/Supplier drop-down always failed; Mantle's list search matched only ids | `choices` is a table of sources searching their names in the query, ignoring case; Mantle's `query` matches names and descriptions. A spec calls every choice with a selected value outside the page |
| F64 | Review: the palette's record links checked BOSS group names; finance reads were "holds any finance permission", so Projects' managers, who hold `RECEIVABLE_EDIT` to bill, could read receivables and payments | Mantle seeds `RECEIVABLE_VIEW`, `PAYABLE_VIEW` and `PAYMENT_VIEW`; a kind reads from its view permission or `ACCOUNTING_VIEW`, an edit permission alone opens nothing, and BOSS grants the views to AR, AP, treasury and admin. The palette uses the permission-derived capability. Specs in both repositories (decided with the user) |
| F65 | Review: AccountDetail overwrote the report's account filter with its own account, and the GeneralLedger report's links dropped it | Report links carry the report's options; AccountDetail's account is `recordId` |
| F66 | Review: JournalEntryDetail and AccountDetail read their record in `always-actions`, which run for every `choices` request, and failed the page for a missing record; Publish showed on a published template; a batch could be posted without its review; row dialogs had fixed ids | Records are read in `actions` with a Not available state; actions follow state; posting is from the review only; row dialog ids carry the row key |
| F67 | Review: AccountingControls' "opt-in issuance adjustments" built its hard lock date with `toISOString()`, a UTC day, so it locked today from evening on in the Americas and failed (reproduced at the committed code) | The date is formatted in the user's zone |
| F68 | Review: a widget that fails renders its error into the output, not `errorMessages`, so the status-only Accounting specs passed broken pages; negative access helpers counted any error, including validation errors, as a refusal; a "reader sees no New batch" check named a button that did not exist | Specs check rendered text and render errors, pair negative cases with positive ones, and check controls present for the users who have them |
| F69 | Review: the screens copied a 12-parameter block and 7-parameter responses, faked one page with about 60 hand-set page fields, duplicated invoice/bill/payment screens and PostingDefaults' Add and Edit forms, and loaded `Accounting.js` to format dates | `template/AccountingParts.xml` and `AccountingDocuments.xml`; services page their lists and return display text (`AccountingPolicy.display`), party and status names |
| F70 | Review: the BOSS Accounting scripts and specs used Prettier's defaults rather than the documented style, and the screens a different XML formatter and a one-line license header | Reformatted; `.prettierrc.json` at the mr-moqui root; full headers restored |
| F71 | P4: the installed generic `ItemSales` mapping points to a non-postable summary account; using it in the finalized demo caused the whole demo data file to roll back | Demo and consulting walks use the valid `ItemTimeEntry` mapping. P19 readiness must identify non-postable mappings explicitly; no global chart remapping is assumed |
| F72 | P4: legacy customer credits reverse the parties, which made them appear payable and selected purchase-side expense accounts | Native guarded credits retain their financial side and original source account allocations; common lists, links and posting lock scopes use that side |
| F73 | P4: an invoice timestamp near midnight displayed as different days to its creator and approver, changing the typed lock day | New invoices capture an audited SQL DATE `accountingDate` from the creator's chosen day. Adopted original postings persist that day; locks, summaries, rebuilds, unpost/repost, trial balance, ledger and issued output agree. A later effective reversal uses its own day. Existing posted legacy rows remain undated and retain their original timestamp semantics |
| F74 | P4: QVT prepares form metadata even when a record's section is hidden; a null invoice context still dereferenced its currency | Detail and shared contexts normalize safe empty maps after computing record availability; unavailable records are covered in QVT and TUI |
| F75 | P4 review: the design names invoice budget links, but this Mantle checkout has no InvoiceItemBudget entity or invoice-line budget keys; PaymentBudgetAllocation links payments only | Invoice Budget details reports unavailable evidence. P15 supplies the invoice commitment model; no fictitious link or financial writer is introduced in P4 |
| F76 | P4 visual review: EntityAuditLog stores new SQL DATE accountingDate changes as epoch text, which the generic invoice History values display without formatting | P21 output finishing formats typed audit date values and status/user labels; source audit evidence remains unchanged |
| F77 | P4 visual review: an unusually long invoice ID makes the 390px HTML print slightly wider than its viewport, and its Description heading can wrap mid-word | P21 output finishing refines narrow-screen print wrapping; the exported PDF and actual monetary values remain correct |
| F78 | P4 review: generic Files removal and resource-only version replacement could mutate an issued archive even when its InvoiceContent row was guarded | Durable PDFs/supporting copies live outside mutable record folders. Native content invariants protect identity/removal and equivalent DbResource aliases before writes; generic Files respects immutable rows and native per-side edit authority |
| F79 | P4 final visual review: Quasar Files list captions and neutral controls inherited light-mode colors in dark mode; a nested conditional spec branch also had bare expressions that did not assert | Shared RecordFiles passes the active theme to its list/item hosts. Actual issued rows pass unchanged text/control contrast thresholds after theme transitions finish. Client isolation branches now explicitly assert their permission and omission checks |
| F80 | P4 repeated walk: legacy sole-store fallback advances an invoice from Finalized to Sent asynchronously after its Send form reads the timestamp | Send submits the already-supported exact financial source fingerprint and selected attachment versions, without its redundant timestamp. Native eligibility, organization and revision checks remain strict; header/item/state writes retain timestamps. Regressions prove status-only advancement succeeds and changed financial fields refuse before durable output or mail |
| F81 | P5a: actor-formatted legacy document dates could allow October settlement against an undated source or target actually posted in November UTC | `AccountingPolicy.postingDay` uses persisted SQL days, otherwise the unchanged UTC ledger timestamp day. Preview evidence and locked confirmation include every original source/target posting day, including adjustment-only targets; earlier settlement refuses. Undated reversals cannot borrow an invoice's earlier SQL day |
| F82 | P5a: legacy/raw application writers can race a reviewed settlement or skip period checks when no extra application GL is needed | Separately adopted `settlementApplicationGuardEnabled` serializes organization/documents/applications/original postings before all application writers, checks balances and dates, and captures currency/day on new adopted rows. Existing history is not backfilled; default-off fields and audit behavior are covered independently |
| F83 | P5a: restoring only part of a receipt already posted directly to its invoice changes open items without a matching GL movement; overstated imported payment amounts can also exceed their actual backing | Direct restoration requires the entire available balance to its actual original invoice with consistent history. Shared signed control proof checks actual original cash against its document; genuinely unapplied cash still permits partial applications. Native and generic writers share the history/control rules |
| F84 | P5a: unpost/reverse/move and raw header/entry writes could invalidate already consumed source backing; a raw delete could disguise a positive stored application with an unsaved zero | Applied sources retain their original postings until unapplied. Raw reversal construction is guarded too. Application identity/dates are immutable, zero reactivation refuses, and deletion locks/rechecks the actual stored row, ignoring unpersisted financial changes |
| F85 | P5a: cached invoice totals and an arbitrary first-200 cutoff lose eligible open items; PostgreSQL does not accept a numeric currency scale in `ROUND` | SQL views aggregate rounded invoice lines and both application sides before filtering/counting/paging. The currency scale is an integer. Four typed lists page independently; selected revisions stay available outside a search page, without silently refreshing reviewed versions |
| F86 | P5a full gates: its original fixture prefix collided with P4; legacy ClientBilling cleanup encountered the newly inherited adoption flag and left Projects data behind; a nested role helper reset callers to system administration | P5 fixture identities are distinct. The legacy projection spec explicitly selects default-off behavior and restores the exact inherited flag in cleanup's `finally`. Nested role helpers restore their calling identity; Treasury's valid negative and AR positive use the same payload |
| F87 | P5a full gate exposed an existing variant-policy timing race: its default effective time was compared against a second, later clock read | `CatalogSettings.storeVariantSettings` captures the clock once and keeps default revisions strictly ordered, matching the catalog-policy writer. Explicit backdated input still refuses without changing policy history |
| F88 | P5a browser correction: saved error parameters for a failed preview form overrode its current computed draft after an adjustment account was corrected; the row and URL were current while both form field sets were stale | The computed-only preview action uses the existing hidden-form POST link with current `workbench.editParameters`. The browser regression inspects the actual submitted hidden draft before review and application; no global editable-form watcher, forced Vue state or reload bypass is used |
| F89 | P5a browser navigation: Back to selection inherited the current preview ID from the destination's declared parameters and rendered the old review again | Selection links explicitly clear retained preview/operation IDs, and Clear selection also clears its draft. Original selected revisions, amounts, account/reason, filters and fixed dates remain retained |
| F90 | P5b1: joined payment views do not retain the authoritative Payment stamp, and cached totals can miss actual applications | Native revisions use the base Payment and authoritative application/posting/method evidence; filtered reads use narrow scoped projections |
| F91 | P5b1: a direct legacy application can share its header invoice with unrelated receipts; reviewed cash corrections still meet the manual-posting gate | Cash-source dependencies retain their own applications. Only exact reviewed state/unapply controllers join the existing PostingGuard validation; an identical Treasury actor's unreviewed Ledger reversal still refuses |
| F92 | P5b1: content metadata alone cannot make issued bytes immutable | Native guards protect DbResource identity, files/history, blob metadata/chunks and immutable output/content links; ordinary supporting files remain mutable |
| F93 | P5b1: drive/search/public tokens and another record's content pointer could expose a private issued archive | Native URI access guards and canonical cross-record filtering protect each path; generic resource search gains optional subtree exclusions before search limits, preserving callers that omit them |
| F94 | P5b1: first archive references and deduplicated blobs can be uncommitted when a raw resource writer checks them | Issuance and existing ancestor/blob/chunk mutation share stable mantle/content locks and fresh reference reads. New unpublished upload identities avoid the suspended-parent ForceNew deadlock. Real races pass; removing the blob lock alone reproduces byte/metadata corruption |
| F95 | P5b1: a commit worker has no interactive actor context, and late publication could reopen a decided validation request | Durable event-bound publication retains the actor, checks each recipient independently, uses stable delivery identities and retires obsolete/decided requests under lock |
| F96 | P5b1: demo-data loading can issue payment documents before normal host PDF installation | The host installs the renderer during factory data loading and drains workers before its guard ends. Host lint/build pass; two host test failures reproduce with the two-line change removed |
| F97 | P5b1 browser: self-dependent dropdowns clear their selected party/method/evidence/application value | Remove all 20 self-dependencies, retain 16 real external dependencies and pass form-scoped initial selections. Browser checks inspect actual selected revision tokens before submission |
| F98 | P5b1 rendered-output proof: an isolated app root cannot resolve mounted shared links; Treasury correctly omits ledger IDs | Real admin/Treasury-owned operations render through the actual mount at the correct standalone level in QVT/TUI/HTML, asserting enabled file identities and separately authorized ledger presence/omission |
| F99 | P5b1 screenshot review: full-page Chromium capture can hide a 15px scrollbar after choosing its clip width and crop the light document's right edge | Final-theme outer/inner/root bounds and viewport companion captures prove actual check fit. Generic full-page capture correction remains tooling work; no further product-layout change is inferred from the cropped artifact |
| F100 | P5b1 browser: a successful draft edit from 21 to 22 left a previous failed delivery form's sourceVersion in session restoration; a new form instance received that old initial value | After successful native store only, the app consumes the prior saved failed-submit values through the existing errorParameters getter. Same-revision reference/reason/evidence remains retained, failed saves stay untouched, own-edit review receives its new revision, and external stale confirmation still refuses |
| F101 | P5b2 legacy provider entry could race first native adoption, including a manual instrument with an explicit configured provider; an outer rollback could otherwise erase the only evidence of old I/O | Durable per-payment admission fences commit before old provider I/O and serialize first adoption. Shipped and configured legacy leaves, wrappers, refund links, order/invoice loops and polling reload stored identity and exclude managed records. Real competing calls, native adoption and caller rollback are covered |
| F102 | P5b2 interstage reads could retain a caller's repeatable-read snapshot, and interrupted lookup replay omitted its claimed attempt version | Orchestrator-only fresh attempt reads join separate committed stages; lookup claim results retain the exact version and summary. Actual outer rollback and concurrent pre-finish lookup replay prove durable result identities |
| F103 | P5b2 credential preparation could validate an ordinary old PaymentMethod read while projecting newer locked bank/card data | Private preparation projects only freshly locked method/subtype rows, compares the hash of those same values to the retained revision, and commits before adapter I/O. Safe adapters explicitly guarantee consumption of this by-value snapshot; lookup retains original identity independently of rotated credentials |
| F104 | P5b2 source checks could miss target-only payments, accept a real APP id with altered links/currency, or inspect only a candidate's replacement source | Common guards inspect stored and candidate payment identities under stable locks, validate all APP links/currency, and preserve positive application identity with flags off. Exact negative proofs include a real initially unmanaged AP-header/adoption race. The held manual-source reparent proof is required before P5b2b enables cash holds |
| F105 | P5b2 full-suite verification exposed legacy fixture cleanup/corruption using raw financial EntityValue/deleteAll writes without a transaction; guarded source locks refused and ClientBilling cleanup left later Projects fixtures behind | Financial fixture mutations use the existing transactional generic services, retaining their original assertions and default-off business behavior. Full BOSS rerun passes 1,161/0/5; standalone Mantle passes 1,139 with only the same four reproduced baseline failures and 17 skips |
| F106 | P5b2 visual review found the phone gateway table scrolling 560 px inside a 359 px container, with the actual provider amount beyond the visible right edge | Mobile identity links wrap, the two columns retain actual amount/currency and separate compact provider/local outcomes, and full reference/code details remain on the exact selected authorized attempt. Per-row geometry checks include amounts and chip content, beyond document-width checks. Gateway reviews also omit the empty generic state-effects grid; real B1 effects still render |
| F107 | P5b2 browser retries exposed data-dependent clicks on wrapped inline attempt IDs: the locator's union-rectangle center can fall between actual text fragments and hit the surrounding form-group | Attempt links have a rectangular block target at every width; tests verify the actual single rectangle and center hit before the unchanged normal click. Generic locator hit-point selection remains test-tooling work; no forced clicks or native financial identity changes are used |
| F108–F112 | P5b2b: legacy refunds without a native backing record, banking rows read apart from the locked ones, the legacy fence's admission for first adoption, the refund's retained posting policy, refund draft claims | Resolved in P5's own code, which R2 deleted; they no longer apply |
| F113 | P5b3: the transit account 258300000 had no default organization assignment; the fee account 550000000 is cost of sales | The assignment is installed with the PtInternalTransfer mappings, and the demo adds only what is missing. A transfer fee needs an expense account (`find#InternalTransferFeeAccounts`) |
| F114 | P5b3: transfers showed as unapplied trade cash | `find#Payments`' Unapplied queue and the trade settlement scope leave out PtInternalTransfer, before counting and paging |

| F115 | R2: P4–P5 rebuilt beside Mantle what Mantle had, ported from Moqui Java and used in production: the gateway path (`*#SinglePayment` and the gateway interfaces, with an adapter interface only a test double implemented), refunds (`create#RefundPayment`), the `apply#*` services, `post#Payment`, which posts both sides of a payment from the organization to itself, `get#InvoicePrintInfo`, `EmailTemplate`, `get#ReceivableStatementInfo`, `create#InvoiceCreditMemo`, the stored invoice totals and NotificationMessage | §2 "Use Mantle first". P4–P5 rebased on those services and the copies deleted (§4, R2) |
| F116 | R2: payment state changes wrote `statusId` directly, so the Payment SECAs did not run: `PaymentGlPost`, the cancelled-payment cleanup, `clear#PaymentTrans` and the FinancialAccountTrans SECAs | State changes go through `update#Payment` along `StatusFlowTransition`, and unapplication through `unapply#PaymentApplication`, whose SECA reverses the posting |
| F117 | R2: authorization from caller names (`getStackNameString()`, 19 sites in 13 modules), held together by EECAs and SECAs on hot paths: every Payment, PaymentApplication, AcctgTrans, AcctgTransEntry, DbResource and ContentBlob write, and a pre-service SECA on every service (`service=".*"`) | `PostingGuard` decides an automatic posting from the transaction's source fields and asks `ACCOUNTING_GL_POST` of a manual or reversal posting unless its caller passes `reviewed`; the rules the EECAs enforced are in `post#AcctgTrans` and the apply and unapply services. The guard EECAs and SECAs are gone; `IssuedInvoiceContentImmutable` remains |
| F118 | R2: test entities, services and SECAs were loaded in production; one SECA hooked every `post#AcctgTrans` and ran a script from `test/` | Deleted. The test gateway is in `PaymentTestServices.xml` (`alwaysPending#*`, `alwaysDecline#PaymentRelease`, `alwaysDecline#PaymentRefund`); a spec makes its own gateway configuration and faults |
| F119 | R2: adoption flags defaulting to N gave each rule two code paths, and most specs ran the old one | Retired, but `postingGuardEnabled` (§4) |
| F120 | R2: nearly every service was a one-line `<script>` into a module of 1,000 to 1,600 lines; helpers were copied (`same` six times, `json` four, line totals five, lock checks four), and one copy of `partyNames` showed parties another user keeps private; parameter interfaces were copied unions | Services are inline XML Actions, with modules for involved logic. `EntityLib.js` in Mantle and `AccountingLib.js` in BOSS hold the shared helpers; `partyNames` leaves out private parties; each service declares its own parameters |
| F121 | R2: transfer method dates compared as ISO strings; a posting or application without a calendar day took its timestamp's UTC day while its invoice took the user's day, so an evening application in the Americas was refused as before its own invoice | `EntityLib.bookDay`: the calendar day, else the timestamp's day in the user's zone, for posting and application days, the fiscal period lookup, `check#NextFiscalTimePeriods` and the summary recalculation (replaces F81's UTC day). The transfer module that compared ISO strings is gone |
| F122 | R2: settlement adjustments were `ItemTimeEntry` items; the workbench carried its draft, up to 256 KB, in each URL; Mantle accepted HTML built by the screen as the issued invoice; a payment was read twice per page | Adjustments are discount or write-off credit memos (`create#InvoiceCreditMemo`), applied to their invoice; the draft is kept behind an id (`store#`/`get#SettlementDraft`); Mantle renders the issued invoice from its template (`printHtml` removed) |
| F123 | R2: unapplying a payment posted straight to its invoice failed when it had several applications; `store#Account` called `set#GlAccountFlags` with the wrong parameter | Both fixed (mr-mantle `90573cb0`, `c820c444`) |
| F124 | R2: the screenshot specs saved images nothing compared, and their checks repeated the qvt and tui render specs; P4–P5 added about 17,000 lines of Mantle specs in 57 files, with busy-waiting test doubles | Screenshot specs removed in every component; each walk keeps what needs the live client; Mantle's Accounting specs went from 19,100 to 7,681 lines |
| F125 | R2: PaymentDetail was 2,733 lines (four screens in one, five copies of one dialog); 789 lines of P4–P5 XML and 357 of P0–P3 ran over 130 characters; tabs wrapped a shared template; the choices transition had four copies; labels said "reviewed" | Receivables tabs own their content, one choices transition, P0–P3 and receivables XML wrapped at 130 (mr-boss `f0cca60`). PaymentDetail a header screen with tabs that own their content, reviews as their own screens, one draft form, state dialog and gateway dialog (mr-boss `5225cc7`) |
| F126 | R2: a payment's version was a fingerprint built with copied exclude blocks, and Payment carried copies of what other records hold (`financeOrganizationPartyId`, `financeDirection`, `accountingDate`, `settlementAccountingDate`, `lifecycleManaged`) | A payment's version is its `lastUpdatedStamp`; the organization comes from its OrgInternal party and the book day is `effectiveDate` (mr-mantle `304ab31e`) |

| F130 | P6, Products' state (P0's check): Products P6 built `Shared/Supplier360` with the Products context only; its always-actions refuse another app root (`CatalogServices.get#SharedContext`). Purchasing is not started: there was no SupplierProfile, and `BOSS_PURCHASING_BUYER` is not seeded, so only AP intake holds `PAYABLE_IMPORT` | P6 builds SupplierProfile's finance fields in Mantle; the buyer's grant comes with its group (Manufacturing P14) |
| F131 | P6: `create#PurchaseShipmentInvoices` declared `invoiceIdList` and never set it | It returns the invoices of `create#SalesShipmentInvoices` |
| F132 | P6: the framework's `get#UserNotifications` took one `topic`, not the list F43 assumed | mr-moqui `550f4258` adds `topicList`; Approvals is the Commons Notifications mount filtered by Accounting's topics |
| F133 | P6: InvoiceItem has no facility, and a payment has no lines, so AC-22's "copied with the facility by the invoice and payment auto-post services" has nothing to copy for the facility or for a payment | The invoice postings carry a line's cost center, else its order line's; the facility on bill lines and payment postings are left for AC-22's follow-up (§7) |
| F134 | P6: a tab's transition answering `.` keeps only the declared parameters present in the context, so a row action whose form did not post the record's id returned to the tab without its bill | The forms post the id (BillDetail's Holds); docs/dev/Practices-App-Dev.md's "Declare only the parameters a screen reads" covers it |
| F135 | P6: a shared screen's tabs are one subscreen list for every mount, and the menu shows a tab by the artifact authorization of its file, which cannot differ by mount; Products' Supplier360 tabs need the Products context and Accounting's need Accounting's | Accounting's supplier context is its own 360 screen (§4); one Supplier360 with per-app tabs needs a framework way to choose tabs by mount |
| F136 | P6: Customer360 and Supplier360 each had a finance details tab over the same Mantle writers | One template, `template/AccountingFinanceDetails.xml`; each route screen sets the party and the side |
| F137 | P6 review: `import#Bill` for a receipt attached a repeat upload to the receipt's draft and dropped a conflicting reference; `create#InvoiceFromSource` keyed the received basis per order part, so a second delivery could not be billed, and checked the source before answering a retried operation key; the customer finance writers let the caller's side choose the permission | A receipt's bill takes one supplier upload, a reference on another bill is refused first, and a later upload or a bill no longer a draft is refused naming it; each receipt is billed once on its accepted quantity; the operation key is answered first; the side counts only its own relationship. Specs for each |
| F150 | P7, P0's F50 and D21: Mantle has no inspection record; the only held evidence is an accepted receipt whose asset is in `AstQuarantine` | That quantity is held and left out of the match (`MeInspectionHold`), and the inspection check is reported unavailable (`inspectionCheck`), never passed; `get#SourceInspectionStatus` replaces it with CX-QUALITY (§7) |
| F151 | P7: a scheduled ServiceJob runs with no user, so the re-evaluation job cannot pass `hold#Invoice`'s `INVOICE_HOLD` check, and a match operator without AP holds no `INVOICE_HOLD` either | The match places its own exception hold (§4) |
| F152 | P7: Settings is denied to every Accounting group but the finance administrator, so MatchPolicies cannot offer the backfill to AP and the match group as design §15 says | `Payables/LegacyMatches`, linked from MatchPolicies (§4) |
| F153 | P7: `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_MATCH` held only `INVOICE_MATCH`, which opens no bill read and no Payables screen, so a match operator could not open the bill it matches | The group gets `PAYABLE_VIEW` and the Payables screens' authorization; AccountingShell's match role now sees Payables |
| F154 | P7: P6's received-basis billing (`create#InvoiceFromSource`) and Mantle's receipt billing decide a receipt is billed by `AssetReceipt.invoiceId`, not by `OrderItemBilling` | A match also gives a receipt with no invoice the bill line, as `apply#InvoiceItemToOrder` does, and unapply clears it, so a matched receipt is not billed again from its order |
| F155 | P7: a corrected receipt can leave the matches of an order line over its accepted total; each bill's re-evaluation sees only what the other bills already billed | The job names each such match a source change and holds its bill; a buyer or AP corrects the source or unapplies a match |
| F190 | P9: the demo organization BOSS_ACCT_ORG had no assignment of the stored-value liability and clearing accounts (251100000, 251200000, 251500000, 258100000, 258200000) that `FinancialAccountTypeGlAccount` and `FinancialAccountReasonGlAccount` map, so the posting guard refused every financial account movement | The demo assigns them. P19's readiness names a mapped account the organization does not have |
| F191 | P9: `post#FinancialAccountTrans` created its transaction without `finAccountTransId`, so the posting guard took a deposit or withdrawal for a manual entry and asked for a reviewed operation from a user without `ACCOUNTING_GL_POST` | Fixed: the transaction names its FinancialAccountTrans (mr-mantle `c12815d7`) |
| F192 | P9: `match#PaymentMethodTransUnmatched` reconciled a line with the first of several payments or ledger entries of the same amount (F33), and a receipt on a deposit could be matched on its own | It reconciles only a line with one possible match, and leaves deposited receipts to their deposit's line |
| F193 | P9: BAI2 has no transaction id, so `import#BaiVersion2` numbered lines from a sequence and a file imported again was imported twice (F33); its control-sum message gave the file's time in UTC | A BAI2 or CSV line is keyed by a hash of its source row and its occurrence in the file; `import#BaiVersion2` and `import#OfxVersion1` share `BankReconciliation.js`'s readers with `review#StatementImport` and skip known lines; the time is in the user's zone |
| F194 | P9: the Mantle reconciliation services checked no permission and the financial account services cannot (orders and payments call them) | New `check#BankAccess` and `check#FinancialAccountAccess`; the Banking screens call them before the older services, and the new services call them themselves |
| F195 | P9: the client test browser cannot set a file input, so a walk cannot upload a statement file | StatementImport also takes the statement pasted as text (`statementText`), which the walk uses; the file upload is the same service parameter as a FileItem |
| F196 | P9: `container-box` has no `condition` attribute, and one given is ignored without a lint finding: an empty Deposits box showed | Wrapped in a `section` with the condition. A lint of unknown attributes is a framework matter (not changed here) |
| F197 | P9 review: `reconcile#BankLine` trusted any candidate value, and `reconcile#PaymentMethodTrans` moved a payment off another line even when a finished statement had cleared that line | Under the line's lock, the line must be open and the candidate one of its candidates now (`checkedCandidate`); taking a payment or entry from a finished statement's line is refused; `apply#Rules` goes through `reconcile#BankLine` |
| F198 | P9 review: the OFX account and currency refusals printed the stored routing and account numbers | The bank account is named by its masked label; only the file's own values are shown |
| F199 | P9 review: one payment matched by two lines was given to the first line by `apply#Rules` and `match#PaymentMethodTransUnmatched` | Neither line gets it; `test#Rule` shows both as ambiguous ("Another line matches the same payment") |
| F200 | P9 review: an OFX DTPOSTED without a time was midnight UTC, the day before in the Americas | A day without a time is that calendar day in the user's zone |
| F201 | P9 review: the deposit branch did not lock the deposit, and left the receipts' bank ledger entries unreconciled | The deposit is read under lock; its receipts' entries on the bank's account become AterRec (AterNot when unreconciled) |
| F202 | P9 review: two commits of one statement import could run at once | `claim#StatementImport` marks it importing (SimCommitting) in its own transaction; a second commit is refused |
| F203 | P9 review: a BAI2 line's key used the group's as-of time, so a corrected file with another time duplicated its lines | The key is the as-of day, type, amount and bank reference (the whole record when there is no reference) |
| F290 | P14: `TaxAuthorityRate` was commented out, its relationship keyed by `taxAuthGeoId` and `taxAuthPartyId`, which are not TaxAuthority's key (F41) | Active, keyed by `taxAuthorityId`, with the collecting organization and the rate type `TarSalesTax`, written through `store#Rate` |
| F291 | P14: `calculate#SalesTaxLocal` only logged and `calculate#InvoiceSalesTax` was empty (F41); the `calculate#SalesTax` interface had no tax date, store or currency, and its results no rate version, base or rounding | Both implemented (`SalesTax.js`); the interface gained the inputs and result fields, optional for other gateways |
| F292 | P14: an invoice without a store had no tax gateway, and nothing chose one for an organization | `PartyAcctgPreference.taxGatewayConfigId` (§4) |
| F293 | P14: tax lines posted through `ItemTypeGlAccount`; `TaxAuthorityGlAccount` was read by nothing (F41) | `get#InvoiceItemGlAccount` takes `taxAuthorityId`; a sales tax line posts to the organization's account for its authority, else the item type's. Purchase tax lines still post by item type |
| F294 | P14: the 1099 selection was every vendor whose approved invoices dated in the year totalled 600 or more, with no eligibility (F41) | `run#Vendor1099Statements` (§4), each vendor its own step with its failure named |
| F295 | P14: `create#TaxStatement`, `delete#TaxStatement` and the 1099 services check no permission, and §2 puts permission checks on new services only | The new statement services check `TAX_STATEMENT_EDIT`; Tax's delete checks the capability and organization in BOSS before `delete#TaxStatement`, which now refuses an exported statement (`STATEMENT_EXPORTED`) |
| F296 | P14: `ItemVatTax` is not left out of totals, and `TaxAuthority.includeTaxInPrice` has no calculation (F41) | Not in the first release (US sales tax, design §20); the local gateway calculates tax on top of the price only. §7 country packs |
| F297 | P14: `delete#InvoiceItem` refuses a line with child items, so a line with a tax line under it could not be removed from a draft | `change#InvoiceState` removes the calculated tax lines when an invoice goes back to draft; finalize calculates them again |
| F298 | P14: InvoiceItem had nowhere to keep a tax line's rate version, base or rounding | `InvoiceItem.taxAuthorityRateId`, `taxableAmount`, `taxPercentage` and `taxRoundingAmount` |
| F299 | P14: TaxStatement has no organization, status or amounts; payroll's W-2 statements share it | A statement's organization is its period's party; `reportedAmount`, `taxAmount`, `lineCount`, `createdDate`/`createdByUserId` and `exportedDate`/`exportedByUserId`/`exportFormat` added. Tax lists sales tax and 1099 statements only |
| F300 | P14: a sales tax statement dates its lines by `invoiceDate`, not the invoice's book day (`accountingDate`) | First release; P11's close and P16's reports decide whether tax periods follow the book day |
| F301 | P14: `create#InvoicePayment` declared `statusId` (`default="paymentStatusId"`) through its Payment auto-parameters, before `paymentStatusId`; called without `statusId` (its REST route, the 1099 spec), the payment was left with no status | Fixed in Mantle: `statusId` is excluded from the auto-parameters and declared after `paymentStatusId`. The tax spec pays through it without `statusId`; the payroll, flow and payables callers pass |
| F302 | P14 review: `PartyAcctgPreference.taxGatewayConfigId` had no writer but a raw update | It is a preference field of `store#Preferences` (`ACCOUNTING_ADMIN`, audit-logged, an unknown gateway refused) and of AccountingPreferences (`taxGateways` choice); the demo sets it through `store#Preferences` |
| F303 | P14 review: a discount of the whole sale (an `ItemDiscount` line with no parent) was left out of the taxable base | The local gateway spreads such discounts over the taxable lines (shipping aside) in proportion to their bases, the last taking the rounding; the interface items carry `parentItemId` |
| F304 | P14 review: the authorities came from the rates, so an authority with nexus in the destination and no rate was silently untaxed | The authorities are those with nexus whose geo is the destination's; one with no rate in effect refuses `TAX_RATE_MISSING`. A nexus row (`TaxAuthorityParty.isNexus`) is sales tax nexus |
| F305 | P14 review: calculated tax lines were known by their rate version, which another gateway may not give, so a reopen could leave them and the next finalize double them | `InvoiceItem.taxCalculated`; reopen clears the calculated lines of any gateway, only on a draft |
| F306 | P14 review: one organization's administrator could change a shared authority's header or a rate for every organization, and nexus rows changed in place | `AUTHORITY_SHARED` and `RATE_SHARED` unless a system administrator; TaxAuthority and TaxAuthorityParty fields audit-logged; a nexus or registration change ends the row in effect and starts a new one, and an empty `partyTaxId` clears it |
| F307 | P14 review: TaxStatementDetail showed the payer's and recipient's taxpayer numbers in full | Only their last four digits on screen; the export has them in full |
| F308 | P14 review, smaller items: the clear path took any status; an order part with no address had no destination; the 1099 run counted card and network payments; an adjusting tax line posted by item type; the export was a GET link; a statement could be made twice by a retry; a second 1099 run failed vendors already done, unlocked | Clear needs a draft; the origin address stands in; card and third-party instruments are left out (1099-K); `post#InvoiceAdjustment` passes `taxAuthorityId`; export is a posted, confirmed action; `create#SalesTaxStatement` takes an `operationKey`; a vendor done is skipped, its check under its Party lock, and its statement made in the run's transaction |
| F309 | P14 review: a sales tax statement sums the tax lines of issued sales invoices; customer credits and returns do not net against it | §7, with P17's returns and credit memos |

  ElectronicInvoices, with AC-15, AC-17, and the FX revaluation and deferral parts of AC-16.
- **With Manufacturing:** ProductionCostClose and CostingPolicies: `mantle.ledger.ProductionCostServices`
  (`store#AllocationPolicy`, `ACCOUNTING_ADMIN`; `preview#CostClose`, `ACCOUNTING_GL_POST`; `post#CostClose`,
  `PRODUCTION_COST_POST`), with `ironstone.accounting.ProductionCostServices.find#CostCloseQueue` for Home's queue;
  `ProductionAllocationPolicy`; the ProductionCostReview topic, seeded in Mantle's data, on which Mantle's
  `review#ProductionCosts` notifies Accounting; Accounting's side of the production posting rule (D12); and the
  cost-close part of §16.3 production-to-GL.
- **From P6:** the facility of bill lines and the payment postings' dimensions (F133); Supplier360 as one shared
  screen with per-app tabs (F135); the supplier file of a bill upload through PASS's media staging (P18).
- **From P7:** the tax tolerance and `TaxVariance` check, and the service-acceptance rule of MatchPolicies (§4); a
  manual re-evaluation for a buyer who knows a source changed; a match column and an unmatched queue on Bills; the
  re-evaluation calls of `dispose#Inspection`, `apply#PurchaseRevision` and `settle#Return` with their owners (P17 for
  the return).
- **Other design items:** payment references and the invoice QR block (AC-20); dunning fees and interest;
  percentage distribution across cost centres; the posted-entry hash; inbound direct debit; the country and book packs (cash-basis tax,
  withholding, VAT and tax-inclusive prices, origin-based sourcing, authority filing formats and e-filing, and sales
  tax statements that net customer credits and returns, with P17 (F309));
  statement formats beyond BAI2, OFX and CSV (camt.053, then MT940).
- **Banking (P9):** reopening a finished statement (finance admin, with a reason); creating a bank fee or payment from
  a bank line through a reviewed dialog (`create#TransPayment`); BankAccountDetail's bank files box (P8 shows NACHA and
  Positive Pay on PaymentRunDetail); the bank statement and the stored-value statement prints; financial account
  transfer and reversal; a deposit of receipts recorded without a bank method, which needs a posting from undeposited
  funds to the bank; a rule's ledger account suggestion; `preview#CsvStatement` on the screen (the review step shows
  the read rows).
- **Other apps' contexts:** Customer Service and Sales on Customer360; Purchasing, Warehouse and Customer Service
  on ReturnDetail; Warehouse on ShipmentDetail, and its `Warehouse/Reports/InventoryValuation` mount;
  Maintenance, Manufacturing and Warehouse on EquipmentDetail; Purchasing on InvoiceMatch.
- **Other apps' callers:**
  - Purchasing: `decide#PurchaseApproval`, `close#PurchaseRemainders` and a request cancel (the budget
    commitments); `apply#PurchaseRevision` (match re-evaluation); `accept#ServiceItem` (service-line matching).
    The drop-ship delivery as match evidence is Purchasing P7's, on Moqui Java's model (impl-purchasing §4).
  - Quality: `get#SourceInspectionStatus` and `dispose#Inspection`.
  - Warehouse: Reopen package and put-back, `ship#SupplierReturn`, `post#Count`.
  - Customer Service: `authorize#Return` and `apply#OrderChange`.
  - Projects: a project's link to a Mantle budget (impl-projects §7). Its cost posting is P11's (§4).
- **The rest of the other apps' needs:** the rest of PUR-SUPPLIER (approval status, risk); CX-RETURNS' policy
  records; CX-QUALITY.

## 8. Verification

- **Per phase,** the "Done" rule of §2 and the phase's "usable when".
- **End to end,** run `./moq run`, sign in as `john.doe` and as each demo finance user, and walk each built
  phase's "usable when" in order.
- **Design §16.3**, walkthrough by phase:

| Walkthrough | Phase |
| --- | --- |
| Procure-to-pay | P6 (intake and holds), P7 (matching), P8 (bank change and payment); the supplier upload in P18 |
| Invoice-to-cash | P4 (invoice and statement), P5 (receipt, credit, write-off, retries), P10 (overdue and credit hold), P17 (package reopened after pack), P20 (currency difference) |
| Return-to-refund | P17 |
| Production-to-GL | P13 (revaluation, and the inventory, WIP and GL tie-out); the cost close in §7, with Manufacturing |
| Bank-to-close | P2 (closed periods), P9 (statements and matches), P11 (close), P12 (depreciation into a closed period) |
| Batch/activation | P8 (supplier payment), P9 (statement row), P10 (notice recipient), P12 (asset depreciation), P19 (activation) |
| Access | `AccountingAccess` in every phase; P18 (customer token); P21 (the full walk) |

- **Walks** through the BOSS client specs of §2, asserting what each page shows.

### P0 verification — Oct 29, 2026

Source contracts checked against this checkout. Existing AccountingActivities, LedgerMaintenance and PartyTimePeriods: **18/18 passed**, using `./moq test --nobuild mr-mantle --spec LedgerMaintenance,PartyTimePeriods,AccountingActivities` with a disposable database. P1 includes minimal scoped document lists, draft creation and read-only detail routes to fulfill its shell acceptance criteria; complete document workflows remain P4–P5.

### P1 build — Oct 29, 2026

Implemented the complete finance grant matrix and root filters, isolated demo users, permission-derived native
access, scoped lists/search/record links, draft document creation and read-only routes. Home keeps later aggregates
unavailable and names independent health/count failures. The ledger model is additive preparation for P2/P3.
`AccountingShell` exercises every role, palette source and quick-create grant; `AccountingAccess` and
`AccountingIsolation` cover service, REST, export, file and search boundaries, including disabled artifact authz.


### P2 build — Oct 29, 2026

P2a and P2b are implemented: native posting guard, dated reversal and forward adjustment, configured fiscal
calendar, chart/journal/period editors, trial balance/general ledger, independent batch results, immutable template
versions, dimensions and journal files. Reviewed retries recheck authoritative inputs under lock. No closed-period
bypass or unrestricted posted rewrite was granted. Accounting explicitly adopts the new flags on ORG_ZIZI_CORP;
standalone Mantle retains the legacy defaults. Native controls and the original 18-check ledger baseline pass.

### P3 build — Oct 29, 2026

Implemented native preferences, conflict-preview cloning, all mapping kinds, due terms, dated rates/CSV results,
masked payment methods and organization-approved gateway bindings, numbering and approved document previews.
PostingDefaults identifies missing item defaults through the native invoice resolver as well as missing GL types.
Existing chart accounts can be assigned from ChartOfAccounts. Configuration retains posted accounting meaning and
issued document identities. Installment/discount lines, provider refresh and conversion remain P8/P20.

### R — Review of P0–P3 — Oct 29, 2026

A review of the four P0–P3 commits against docs/Practices-App-Dev.md found the bugs and practice gaps F61–F70, fixed
in mr-boss and mr-mantle, and added what they taught to that document. The detail screens have the record header with
one primary action by state and a More menu, a Not available state and chips with tui twins; lists have names,
amounts and states and real pagination; the invoice, bill and payment screens share one template.

Verified Oct 30, 2026: `./moq test mr-boss` 1,065 passed, 5 skipped; standalone `./moq test mr-mantle` 844 passed with
the four baseline failures (InboxThreads, MantleSearch, WorkTimeEntries, WorkTimesheets) and 17 skipped, PDF specs with
Chromium; `test-client mr-boss` AccountingShots (three users, 31 destinations at 390, 1280 and 1440, light and dark),
AccountingLedgerWalk and AccountingSettingsWalk 230 of 230, screenshots looked at; `moqui lint --screens` 125 flagged
sites as before, none in Accounting. The framework's qvt list toolbar now counts an unpaginated list's rows instead of
saying "No results found" (mr-moqui).

Left for later:
- `AccountingPolicy.js` refuses with plain messages; reason codes (`denied(reason, message)`) and the walks' comparison
  by code wait for that conversion. Its formatting (Prettier defaults) is also still to change.
- Chips have qvt and tui texts only, so printed lists show no state.
- An invoice list fills a draft's missing total with one `get#InvoiceTotal` per row (at most a page).
- JournalTemplates turns the amount form's `parameterName_N` fields into a map in its transition.

### P0–P3 integration verification — Oct 29, 2026

See [AccountingImplementation](../docs/AccountingImplementation.md) for native contracts, routes, reproduction
commands, result counts and the baseline comparison. Every implemented XML route renders in QVT and TUI. Browser
coverage includes all 31 destinations at 390/1280/1440 pixels in light/dark, reviewed posting/reversal, and the P3
assignment/mapping/terms/rates/preferences walk. Screenshots were visually inspected. Screen lint writes to a
separate report: zero parse failures and the existing 125 flagged sites, with no new Accounting hazard.

The original AccountingActivities, LedgerMaintenance and PartyTimePeriods remain 18/18 passing. The standalone
runtime excludes BOSS demo adoption settings; BOSS explicitly opts ORG_ZIZI_CORP into the new guard and dimensions.
No ADMIN exemption, closed-period permission or unrestricted rewrite authorization was added. Full standalone
Mantle retains four pre-existing failures reproduced against archived commit b48e696c: InboxThreads, MantleSearch,
WorkTimeEntries and WorkTimesheets. They are unrelated to the new finance controls.

### Remaining-phase baseline

Before P4 changes, the clean component heads were frozen and checked with the existing develop binary and Chromium
on disposable databases. BOSS at `25478b4` reproduced 1,065 passed, zero failed and five skipped. Standalone Mantle at
`f23f8de6` reproduced 844 passed, 17 skipped and exactly the four failures above. The standalone runtime excludes
BOSS data and adoption settings. Subsequent phase results are compared to these baselines.

### P4 build — Oct 29, 2026

Built:
- `mantle.account.InvoiceServices.change#InvoiceState`, the one invoice state guard over Mantle's status flow: status,
  period, posting, approval and the single-currency refusal (D18), by side permission. Draft edits through
  `store#InvoiceDraft`, `store#InvoiceDraftItem` and `delete#InvoiceDraftItem`; `reverse#DraftInvoice`. Projects'
  `update#InvoiceStatus` calls it.
- `send#Invoice` for any invoice, with or without a store, which freezes the PDF as the invoice's content and records
  the outcome per recipient; `InvoiceFinalizedSendEmail` skips a version it sent. `process#InvoiceBatch`.
- Linked credit memos applied to their original; approved-time billing for customers and workers; statements;
  Customer360's Accounting context with masked finance details (`CustomerFinanceServices`).
- Screens: Invoices, InvoiceDetail (the shared screen with the receivables context and its tabs), BillingQueue,
  InvoiceBatch, Statements and Customer360.

For later phases:
- An invoice records its book day (`Invoice.accountingDate`) and its postings use it (F73; R2 for the user's zone).
- Invoice budget evidence is unavailable until P15 adds commitments (F75).
- The generic `ItemSales` mapping points to a non-postable account; P19's readiness names such mappings (F71).

Verified then: `./moq test mr-boss` 1,110 passed, 5 skipped; standalone `./moq test mr-mantle` 903 passed, with the
four baseline failures and 17 skipped.

Commits: mr-mantle `876732f6`, `93e8fed3`; mr-boss `b933118`, `907a816`, `5b1b900`. R2 replaced its delivery,
recipient and statement snapshot entities, its script-built HTML and its own credit memo service.

### P5 build — Oct 29–30, 2026

Built in slices:
- P5a, settlement: `find#OpenItems`, `preview#Settlement` and `apply#Settlement`, one application set per party and
  currency under an operation key; automatic application (`preview#PaymentAutoApplication`, `autoApply#Payment`);
  ReceivablesWorkbench.
- P5b1, payments: `find#Payments`, `get#PaymentFinanceDetail`, drafts, reviewed state changes (validate, deliver,
  confirm, cancel, void) and unapplication, issued receipts, details and checks, PaymentValidation notices; Payments,
  PaymentDetail with seven tabs, and PaymentPrint.
- P5b2, gateway actions (authorize, capture, release, lookup), manual refunds and gateway refunds; GatewayTransactions.
- P5b3, internal transfers with a fee.

For later phases:
- A settlement is dated on or after the postings of its sources and targets. A discount or write-off goes to an
  explicit account (F23).
- A retry with the same operation key (at most 40 characters) answers the first result; another request under the key
  is refused.
- A transfer posts through the transit account 258300000, and its fee needs an expense account (F113). Transfers are
  not trade cash (F114).
- Due schedules and term discounts are P8's, historical Aging P10's.

Verified then: the last full runs were at P5b2a, `./moq test mr-boss` 1,162 passed, 5 skipped, and standalone
`./moq test mr-mantle` 1,139 passed with the four baseline failures and 17 skipped. At the user's request the refund
and transfer slices ran only their own specs.

Commits: mr-mantle `a79012de`, `8f8c06ad` (F87), `ea31a0aa`, `5c24c2fa`, `501769d0`, `cb9cc35d`, `128f6ca0`,
`9a13f26c`; mr-boss `737c439`, `acc99ca`, `59a4060`, `a8f8a38`, `4b92e2c`, `64f4585`, `bb8a421`, `d24147c`, `848ff21`,
`cadf060`, `49f3001`, `67ded21`. P5 built its gateway path, refunds, transfers, settlement guards and payment outputs
beside Mantle's services, with their own entities, guards and adoption flags; R2 rebuilt them on Mantle's services.

### P9 build — Oct 31, 2026

Built:
- Mantle `ReconciliationServices` on the existing bank lines (`PaymentMethodTrans`): `review#StatementImport`,
  `get#StatementImport` and `commit#StatementImport` for BAI2, OFX and CSV (`preview#CsvStatement` for a CSV's
  columns), a line keyed by the bank's FIT id or by a source-row key, so the same file imported twice adds nothing
  (F33, F193); `StatementImport` keeps each row new, a duplicate or rejected, and commit creates each line in its own
  transaction. `import#BaiVersion2` and `import#OfxVersion1` use the same readers (`BankReconciliation.js`).
- Statement sessions: `BankReconciliation` and `BankReconciliationLine` (keyed by the bank line), `create#`, `get#`,
  `store#` and `finish#Reconciliation`; a period overlaps no other session of the bank, opens at the last finished
  closing balance and finishes only with every line cleared and a zero difference (§4).
- Matching: `find#BankLines`, `find#BankLineCandidates` and `reconcile#BankLine` over `reconcile#PaymentMethodTrans`;
  `BankMatchRule` with `store#Rule`, `test#Rule` and `apply#Rules`, which applies only an exact, unambiguous match;
  `match#PaymentMethodTransUnmatched` reconciles only a line with one match (F192); a finished session's lines refuse
  `reconcile#`, `unreconcile#` and `noReconcile#`, which records its reason. `check#BankAccess` (`BANK_RECONCILE`).
- AC-20 deposits: `PaymentDeposit`, `Payment.paymentDepositId`, `PaymentServices.find#DepositReceipts` and
  `create#DepositSlip` (`PAYMENT_EDIT`, under an operation key); the deposit's one bank line reconciles its receipts,
  and a second line for it is refused (`PaymentMethodTrans.paymentDepositId`).
- `FinancialAccountServices.check#FinancialAccountAccess`; `post#FinancialAccountTrans` names its transaction (F191).
- Screens under `Accounting/Banking`: BankAccounts; BankAccountDetail with the Reconcile, Not reconciled and
  Unreconcile row actions (R-ACC-25), a deposit slip, Add bank line and Match automatically; StatementImport (file or
  pasted text); Reconciliations; ReconciliationDetail (the period's lines in order, Match, Not reconciled, Clear,
  Unclear and Clear selected, Finish); UnmatchedTransactions with the rules' suggestions and Apply rules; BankRules
  with Test (under Banking, §4); FinancialAccounts and FinancialAccountDetail (deposit, withdraw, adjust).
  `ironstone.accounting.BankServices` (`find#Reconciliations`, `find#Rules`, `find#FinancialAccounts`,
  `get#FinancialAccount`) and `Banking.js` (routes and drop-downs). `BOSS_ACCT_BANKING` opens the section for
  treasury, the reader and the finance admin. The demo adds BOSS_ACCT_BANK with three receipts, two bank lines and a
  rule, and assigns the stored-value accounts (F190).

For later phases:
- P11's close can read a period's finished statements (`BankReconciliation.statusId` BrecFinished).
- P19's readiness names mapped accounts an organization does not have, such as the stored-value ones (F190).
- §7 holds reopening a statement, a fee or payment from a bank line, the bank files box, the statement prints, deposits
  of receipts without a bank method and camt.053/MT940.

Review fixes (F197–F203 and the §4 rows of Oct 31): mr-mantle `470f3393`, mr-boss `b976bea`. After them,
AccountingBankReconciliation has 11 features, and the Mantle set above with AccountingControls and AccountingReceivables
passed 177; the mr-boss set 155; the banking walk 3 of 3; lint 125 as before.
`preview#CsvStatement` stays a Mantle service with its spec and is not on the screen: the review step shows the same
rows with their errors.

Verified: standalone `./moq test mr-mantle --spec` AccountingBankReconciliation, BankFileServices,
FinancialAccountServices, OrderToCashBasicFlow, OrderProcureToPayBasicFlow, ReturnToResponseBasicFlow,
InvoicePaymentMisc, AccountingPaymentLifecycle, AccountingInternalTransfers and AccountingCustomerFinance: 119 passed.
`./moq test mr-boss --spec` AccountingBanking, AccountingAccess, AccountingIsolation, AccountingShell,
AccountingScreens, AccountingPayments, AccountingReceivables, AccountingSettlement, AccountingPaymentTransfers,
AppStructure and TuiRender: 155 passed. `./moq test-client mr-boss --serve --spec AccountingBankingWalk,
AccountingPaymentsWalk`: 4 of 4. `moqui lint --screens`: 125 flagged sites as before, none in Accounting. The full
suites were not run.

Commits: mr-mantle `3e46ba26`, `c12815d7`, `fa58b5d1`; mr-boss `8df6e50`, `809944a` and the docs commit.

### R2 — Review of P4–P5 — Oct 30, 2026

A review of P4–P5 against docs/dev/Practices-App-Dev.md found that they rebuilt beside Mantle much of what Mantle
already had, and held the copies together with caller-name checks and guards on hot paths. With the user, P4–P5 were
rebased on Mantle's services and the copies deleted. The practices document gained "Use Mantle before adding to it",
XML Actions first and no screenshot specs.

**Findings** (F115–F126 in §6):
- Parallel stacks beside Mantle: a second gateway path (attempt, instruction, reservation and preview entities, and an
  adapter interface only a test double implemented) behind a "legacy fence" with a pre-service SECA on every service;
  transfers as two raw Payments and hand-built AcctgTrans; refunds beside `create#RefundPayment`; settlement writes
  beside the `apply#*` services; issued outputs, archive and Drive guards with EECAs on DbResource and ContentBlob;
  a notification outbox beside NotificationMessage; invoice print, email and statements as HTML built by string
  concatenation; a linked credit memo beside `create#InvoiceCreditMemo`; totals recomputed beside the stored ones.
- Payment state changes as raw `statusId` writes, which skipped the Payment SECAs.
- Authorization from caller names (`getStackNameString()`, 19 sites in 13 modules), and EECAs and SECAs on hot paths.
- Test entities, services and SECAs loaded in production; one hooked every `post#AcctgTrans`.
- One-line `<script>` services into modules of 1,000 to 1,600 lines; copied helpers, one of which showed private
  parties' names; copied-union parameter interfaces; adoption flags giving each rule two code paths.
- Bugs: settlement adjustments as `ItemTimeEntry` items; transfer method dates compared as ISO strings; references
  cut silently; screen-built HTML accepted as the issued invoice; `isInGroup` in a service; settlement drafts of up to
  256 KB in URLs; two payment reads per page.
- Screens: PaymentDetail at 2,733 lines; 789 lines of P4–P5 XML and 357 of P0–P3 over 130 characters; tabs that
  wrapped a template; four copies of the choices transition; "reviewed" in labels.
- Tests: screenshot specs that nothing compared; about 17,000 lines of P4–P5 Mantle specs in 57 files; busy-waiting
  test doubles.

**Decisions** (§4):
1. Rebase P4–P5 on Mantle's services and delete the parallel stacks.
2. Retire the adoption flags. `postingGuardEnabled` stays, because Mantle's flow specs need the guard off.
3. Remove the screenshot specs in every component. Service implementations are inline XML Actions; JavaScript only
   for involved logic.

mr-moqui: `ab8e4cf4` (`disable-authz` on the XML Actions entity find and write actions, a Parity-Diffs row),
`95e13d1f` (Practices-App-Dev), `ad6658ea` (screenshot specs removed, with mr-boss `8b7c7e2`, mr-pass `b069c42` and
mr-marble `b65b343`; GallerySmoke, ProductsPhone and ProductsPricePrint keep their real checks).

**Rework by area:**

| Area | What changed | mr-mantle | mr-boss |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Walks | AccountingShots and AccountingGatewayShots removed; each Accounting walk keeps one live-client pass (67 s of feature time, from 369 s) | — | `8cf8198`, `8b7c7e2` |
| Pass-throughs | The four AssetBook pass-throughs and the unused `validate#Template` removed; InventoryValuation calls Mantle | — | `b245769` |
| Ledger P1–P3 | Journal attachments in XML Actions; seven ledger modules formatted (2,160 to 1,762 lines); LedgerConfiguration and CloseControls deleted and the simple operations of the others inline XML Actions (AccountingRecords 233 to 117 lines, AccountingSetup 734 to 474, Journals 849 to 746, Currencies 198 to 94); each service declares its own parameters | `301f37ad`, `c820c444` | — |
| Payment lifecycle | State changes through `update#Payment` along StatusFlowTransition and unapplication through `unapply#PaymentApplication`, so the Payment SECAs run; `revert#PaymentPost` and `revert#PaymentApplicationPost` take a `reversalDate`; issued documents are PaymentContent from a template; validation notices are NotificationMessages; ten guard and EECA files deleted | `95d61343` | `320bbb2` |
| Receivables | Print and statement templates over `get#InvoicePrintInfo` and `get#ReceivableStatementInfo`; `send#Invoice` through an EmailTemplate with the PDF as InvoiceContent, and a caller's `printLocation`; `create#InvoiceCreditMemo` links its credit; stored totals; customer finance on existing services; InvoiceDelivery.js, Statements.js and BillingWorkflow.js deleted; tabs own their content and one choices transition; P0–P3 and receivables XML wrapped at 130 | `216fbe99`, `5e32be39` | `de517d6`, `f0cca60` |
| Settlement and transfers | The `apply#*` services take `appliedDate` and `accountingDate` and check every caller; adjustments are discount or write-off credit memos; PaymentApplicationGuard, SourcePostingGuard and their EECAs folded into PostingGuard; the workbench draft behind an id; a transfer is one PtInternalTransfer payment and a fee disbursement; the transfer modules, entities and test SECA deleted | `90573cb0` | `a43b8c1`, `9dfe2f8` |
| Gateway and refunds | `operationKey` on the `*#SinglePayment` services; refunds through `create#RefundPayment` and `refund#SinglePayment`; the test gateway in PaymentTestServices; eleven modules, the legacy fence and 27 spec files (6,824 lines) deleted for two specs | `9355c3ae` | `794d7f3` |
| Consolidation | One PaymentReview entity for every review and the settlement draft; Payment's copied fields removed; EntityLib.js; AccountingPolicy refuses with reason codes; PostingGuard decides from source fields; `get#RecordContentPolicy`; AccountingLib.js and declared screen services in BOSS | `304ab31e` | `52ce9bf` |
| Book days | `EntityLib.bookDay` in the user's zone for postings, applications and periods; `create#Invoice` always records its book day and drafter | `55b87818` | — |
| Payment screens | PaymentDetail a header screen (2,262 to 193 lines) whose tabs own their content; reviews as their own screens (PaymentDetail/Review, Payments/TransferReview, Receivables/SettlementReview) with one confirm and no "I reviewed" checkbox; one draft form, state dialog and gateway dialog in `template/AccountingPayments.xml`; Payments one list (722 to 237 lines), the workbench without its review mode (1,308 to 600); the walks on the new screens, the client suite's server running only fixture specs | `c1821532` | `5225cc7`, `2e66ac4` |

R's first item left for later is done: `AccountingPolicy.js` refuses with reason codes.

**Behavior changes and cuts:**
- Statements show today's open items with aging as of the statement date; there is no opening balance and no stored
  snapshot.
- Unapplying no longer clears `Invoice.paidDate`; Mantle's `unapply#PaymentApplication` does not.
- `apply#InvoicePayment`, `apply#PaymentToPayment` and `apply#InvoiceToInvoice` refuse for every caller: a date before
  a document's posting, an amount finer than the currency, an internal transfer, a gateway authorization or held
  gateway cash, and the application that funds a refund.
- Gateway: no partial capture; a prepared refund cannot be edited and reopened; no evidence files on gateway or refund
  reviews; no ledger preview on refund reviews.
- Transfers: the fee is paid to an outside party, by default the from bank's party; the demo's cash method has none, so
  the form names who is paid. The fee payment points at its transfer (`Payment.feeForPaymentId`).
- Settlement adjustment accounts are found by date over the organization chain, not by the nearest assignment.
- Retired flags: `invoiceHoldGuardEnabled`, `paymentGatewayWorkflowEnabled`, `settlementApplicationGuardEnabled` and
  `paymentAutoApplicationEnabled`. `postingGuardEnabled` now gates only the posting guard and the invoice and payment
  `MAPPING_MISSING` refusal (§4).

**Lines** in the Accounting files: before P4 (mr-mantle `876732f6^`, mr-boss `b933118^`), at the end of P5 (the merges
`de6e6f2d` and `0283176`) and now (HEAD):

| Repository | Files | Before P4 | End of P5 | Now |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| mr-mantle | JavaScript, `service/mantle/{account,ledger}/*.js` | 4,814 | 20,064 | 8,216 |
| mr-mantle | Service XML, those directories and the Accounting, Payment and Invoice SECA files | 16,212 | 18,911 | 22,389 |
| mr-mantle | Entity and EECA XML, the Accounting, Payment, Invoice, Settlement and AssetBook files | 4,174 | 5,594 | 4,569 |
| mr-mantle | Specs and fixtures, `test/Accounting*.js` | 1,882 | 19,100 | 7,681 |
| mr-boss | JavaScript, `service/ironstone/accounting/*.js` and Projects' BillingWorkflow.js | 622 | 4,429 | 3,708 |
| mr-boss | Service XML, `service/ironstone/accounting/*.xml` | 249 | 667 | 1,145 |
| mr-boss | Screen XML, `screen/Accounting*`, Shared Customer360 and InvoiceDetail, `template/Accounting*.xml` | 5,577 | 15,777 | 14,920 |
| mr-boss | Specs, `test/Accounting*.js` and `test/client/Accounting*.js` | 1,445 | 8,992 | 5,329 |

The change from the end of P5 to now includes the P1–P3 rework (mr-mantle `301f37ad` and `c820c444`: JavaScript
−1,340, service XML +1,391, specs +316) and the screenshot specs (mr-boss `8cf8198`: specs −2,178). Service XML grew
because services moved from script modules into XML Actions.

**Verification.** Before the rework, with a Chromium for PDF: `./moq test mr-boss` 1,187 passed, 0 failed, 5 skipped;
standalone `./moq test mr-mantle` 1,195 passed and 9 failed, all in guard and archive specs since deleted. Without a
Chromium for PDF (`pdf_chromium_path`; docs/Run-Deploy.md, docs/dev/Client-Testing.md), every PDF spec fails.

Verification after the rework, Oct 30, 2026, with a Chromium for PDF: `./moq test mr-boss` 1,161 passed, 0 failed, 5
skipped; standalone `./moq test mr-mantle` 991 passed, 1 failed, 1 skipped. The failure is InboxThreads' search
operators, one of the four failures recorded before this work, which fails only while the UTC date is ahead of the local
one. `./moq test-client mr-boss --serve` 39 of 40, the failure ProductsFinish's xlsx download, which this host does not
build; `example` (GallerySmoke) 22 of 22 and mr-marble 41 of 41. `moqui lint --screens`: 125 flagged sites as before,
none in Accounting. Mail capture (`mail_capture_sends`) is for the client walks only: with it on, InboxThreads and
BankOutputFiles fail in the server specs.

### P6 build — Oct 31, 2026

Built:
- Purchasing's contract: `mantle.party.supplier.SupplierProfile`, effective-dated with audit-logged `settlementTermId`
  and `selfBillingIndicator`; `mantle.party.SupplierServices.store#SupplierProfile` (`SUPPLIER_TERMS_EDIT`) and
  `get#SupplierFinance`. The due-date rule takes the supplier's term after the agreement's.
- Intake and approval in `mantle.account.InvoiceServices` (logic in `account/Payables.js`): `find#Payables`,
  `import#Bill` keyed by the supplier's reference (or attaching to a receipt's self-billed draft),
  `create#InvoiceFromSource` on the ordered or received basis, `request#PayableApproval` (§4) and `approve#Payable`.
- Holds: `InvoiceHold` with its four seeded reasons, `hold#Invoice`, `request#HoldRelease`, `release#InvoiceHold` (never
  by the placer) and `get#InvoiceHolds`; the hold guard in approval, every application, `create#InvoicePayment`, the
  open items and the forInvoiceId SECAs, with no flag (§4).
- CX-AUTOMATION: `acceptedOnly` receipt billing and `PartyAcctgPreference.receiptInvoiceSelfBilledOnly` (§4).
- AC-22: `OrderItem.costCenterId` and `InvoiceItem.costCenterId` on the invoice postings (F133 for the rest).
- The BillApproval and BillHoldRelease topics.
- Screens: Bills (queues, Upload bill, Place hold on the selection, the Held tab over `find#BillExceptions`),
  BillDetail (Overview, Holds and InvoiceDetail's tabs), ExpensePosting, Accounting's Supplier360 (F135) with
  Customer360's finance details template (F136), the Accounting context of Shared/OrderDetail and the new
  Shared/ShipmentDetail under Records, and Approvals, the Commons Notifications mount with Accounting's topics (F132).
- After an independent review (F137): a receipt's bill takes one supplier upload; each delivery is billed once; the
  operation key is answered first; the finance writers' side is scoped; `receiptInvoiceSelfBilledOnly` is set in
  AccountingPreferences; decisions mark their notifications read and requests notify the organization's deciders;
  releasing the last hold of an approved bill applies its waiting payments; a cost center is copied onto the bill line;
  a receipt with nothing accepted leaves no empty bill; the demo has a delivered receipt waiting for its bill.

For later phases:
- P7's InvoiceMatch places `IhrMatchException` holds through `hold#Invoice`; no hold is released automatically.
- P8's runs meet the hold guard through the apply services; a bank-detail change hold is `IhrBankChange`.
- §7 "From P6".

Verified Oct 31, 2026 (runtime without a full suite run; the orchestrator runs the suites after merging):
- `./moq test mr-mantle --spec AccountingPayables,AccountingCustomerFinance,AssetReservationMultipleThreads,`
  `OrderProcureToPayBasicFlow,OrderToCashBasicFlow,ReturnToResponseBasicFlow,InvoicePaymentMisc,InvoiceOrderApply,`
  `AccountingSettlement,AccountingSettlementConcurrency,AccountingReceivables,AccountingApplicationRules,`
  `AccountingPaymentLifecycle,AccountingPaymentCorrections`: 162 passed, 0 failed; OrderProcureToPayBasicFlow unchanged.
- `./moq test mr-boss --spec AccountingPayables,AccountingAccess,AppStructure,TuiRender,AccountingShell,`
  `AccountingScreens,AccountingReceivables,AccountingIsolation,AccountingSettlement,AccountingPayments,Billing,`
  `BillingWalk,ClientBilling,MilestoneBillingWalk,ProductsSuppliers`: 200 passed, 0 failed.
- `./moq test-client mr-boss --serve --spec AccountingPayablesWalk`: 1 of 1 (11 s).
- `moqui lint --screens`: 125 flagged sites as before, none in Accounting.

### P14 build — Oct 31, 2026

Built:
- Mantle (`mantle.other.TaxServices`, `SalesTax.js`, `TaxStatements.js`): an active, corrected `TaxAuthorityRate` as
  dated versions keyed to `TaxAuthority`, written by `store#Rate` (`ACCOUNTING_ADMIN`); `store#Authority`
  (`ACCOUNTING_ADMIN`) with the organization's tax account and nexus. `calculate#SalesTaxLocal` and
  `calculate#InvoiceSalesTax` implemented, the organization's gateway (`PartyAcctgPreference.taxGatewayConfigId`) for
  invoices without a store, each tax line keeping its authority, rate version, base, rate and rounding.
  `change#InvoiceState` calculates a sales invoice's tax before finalizing or approving it and refuses one whose tax
  cannot be calculated; tax lines post to the authority's account (`TaxAuthorityGlAccount`). `simulate#SalesTax`,
  `find#SalesTaxLines`, `create#SalesTaxStatement`, `run#Vendor1099Statements` and `export#Statement`
  (`TAX_STATEMENT_EDIT`); `delete#TaxStatement` keeps an exported statement.
- BOSS: the Tax area for the tax group and finance administrators: TaxAuthorities, TaxRates with the simulation,
  TaxStatements (a sales tax statement, the 1099 run with its failures named) and TaxStatementDetail (lines, form
  fields, CSV export); `ironstone.accounting.TaxServices` (`find#Authorities`, `find#Rates`, `find#Statements`,
  `get#StatementDetail`) over `Tax.js`; the tax choices; the demo's Utah sales tax, taxed invoice and 1099 suppliers in
  `Demo.js`.

For later phases:
- P6 edits `store#InvoiceDraftItem` and `change#InvoiceState`: P14's change there is two calls in `InvoiceWorkflow.js`
  (`issue` and the return to draft). Purchase tax lines still post by item type (F293).
- Tax shown on a draft before it is finalized is open (§5); VAT, tax-inclusive prices, origin sourcing and filing
  formats are §7 (F296). P11 and P16 decide whether tax periods follow the book day (F300).

Verified: standalone `./moq test mr-mantle --spec AccountingTax` 9 of 9, and TaxStatementServices,
AccountingReceivables, OrderToCashBasicFlow, InvoicePaymentMisc, OrderProcureToPayBasicFlow,
ReturnToResponseBasicFlow, AccountingControls and AccountingBookDates 136 of 136. `./moq test mr-boss` with every
Accounting spec, AppOrganizationFilters, AppStructure, TuiRender, Billing, BillingWalk, ClientBilling and
MilestoneBillingWalk: 228 of 228. `./moq test-client mr-boss --serve` with the seven Accounting walks: 9 of 9, the
receivables walk with `mail_capture_sends=true` as it says (without it its delivery row waits in vain). `moqui lint
--screens`: 125 flagged sites as before, none in Accounting. The full suites were not run.

Commits: mr-mantle `d9257332`, `8b54ad8b`; mr-boss `2163c8a`, `671b7eb`, `967dd4b` and this record.

Review fixes, Oct 31 (after merging master with P6 and P9): F301 fixed in Mantle, and F302–F308 (the gateway a
preference, sale discounts spread, nexus authorities without a rate refused, calculated lines marked, shared authorities
and rates guarded with dated nexus rows, masked taxpayer numbers, and the smaller items); F309 is §7. Verified: standalone
mr-mantle AccountingTax (12 features) with TaxStatementServices, the receivables, settlement, payables, bank
reconciliation, controls, book-day, payroll and the four flow specs (WorkPlanToCash among them): 215 of 215. mr-boss
every Accounting spec (Payables and Banking among them), AppOrganizationFilters, AppStructure, TuiRender and the four
Billing specs: 241 of 241 after AccountingShell's menu order. The nine Accounting walks with `mail_capture_sends=true`:
13 of 13. `moqui lint --screens`: 125 flagged sites, none in Accounting.


### P7 build — Oct 31, 2026

Built:
- Mantle's match model (`entity/InvoiceMatchEntities.xml`): `InvoiceMatchPolicy` as effective-dated rows with audit-logged
  fields (organization, category or product scope; bill basis, receipt required, quantity and price tolerance, variance
  action, self-billing default); `InvoiceMatch` (one applied per bill, `ImApplied`/`ImUnapplied`, a result, staleness) and
  `InvoiceMatchLine` (the allocation's snapshot, the policy row it applied, its exception and the billing link it wrote).
- `mantle.account.InvoiceMatchServices` (logic in `account/InvoiceMatch.js`): `evaluate#`, `apply#` and `unapply#InvoiceMatch`
  (`INVOICE_MATCH`; apply writes or updates `OrderItemBilling` under lock, refuses excess and already-billed quantity and
  places the match exception hold naming the rule; unapply reverses the links and keeps the hold); `store#`, `end#` and
  `get#MatchPolicies` (`ACCOUNTING_ADMIN` to change); `queue#MatchReevaluation` from the `AssetReceipt` and `InvoiceItem`
  EECAs (indexed reads only) and the `run_MatchReevaluation` job (`run#`/`reevaluate#`), which names each bill's result
  and never releases a hold; `preview#` and `apply#LegacyMatches` from unambiguous evidence only. Quantity in quarantine
  is held and the inspection check reported unavailable (F150). A supplier's first profile row takes the policy's
  self-billing default.
- Screens: BillDetail's Match tab, `Shared/InvoiceMatch` with the Accounting context (bill lines beside their sources,
  Apply and Unapply match, exceptions, the applied match); `Payables/LegacyMatches`; `Settings/MatchPolicies`. The match
  group reads bills and reaches Payables (F153). Demo: BOSS_ACCT_ORG's policy, BOSS_ACCT_PO_MATCH received in full and
  the bills BOSS_ACCT_BILL_MATCH and BOSS_ACCT_BILL_PRICE. No approval topic is added: a match hold is released through
  `BillHoldRelease`.

For later phases:
- P8's runs meet the match hold through the P6 hold guard. P17's `settle#Return`, and Purchasing's revision and quality
  services, call `queue#MatchReevaluation`. §7 "From P7".

Verified Oct 31, 2026, after merging master (P9, P14):
- `./moq test mr-mantle --spec AccountingMatching,AccountingPayables,OrderProcureToPayBasicFlow,OrderToCashBasicFlow,`
  `ReturnToResponseBasicFlow,InvoicePaymentMisc,InvoiceOrderApply`: 92 passed, 0 failed; the flow specs unchanged.
- `./moq test mr-boss --spec AccountingMatching,AccountingAccess,AccountingShell`: 92 passed; `--spec AppStructure,TuiRender,`
  `AccountingPayables,AccountingScreens,AccountingReceivables,AccountingIsolation,Billing,BillingWalk,ClientBilling,`
  `MilestoneBillingWalk`: 120 passed, 0 failed.
- `./moq test-client mr-boss --serve --spec AccountingMatchingWalk,AccountingPayablesWalk`: 2 of 2.
- `moqui lint --screens`: 125 flagged sites, none in Accounting or Shared/InvoiceMatch.
