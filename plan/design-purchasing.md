# IronStone BOSS — Purchasing design

Nov 12, 2026 — impl-maintenance P10: "Maintenance purchases" as built (RequestDetail's originating work order; acceptance from Maintenance's CompleteWork through `accept#ServiceItem`).
Nov 1, 2026 — draft; reviewed against research-purchasing.md, the reference apps and the other core designs ([review-core-apps.md](review-core-apps.md)); the RFQ screens become QuoteRequests, and the bill, match, approval, budget, receipt, return and subcontract handoffs now name one owner and service each; brought in line with the decisions of [impl-purchasing.md](impl-purchasing.md) §4: a supplier's quote is a purchase order, revisions are audit-logged key fields, policies are effective-dated rows, organizations and buyers are party roles, drop-ship follows Moqui Java's branch, and the supplier pages are the PASS Supplier app; consistency pass: brought in line with the Accounting, Warehouse and Products builds and the Nov 1 decisions

IronStone Purchasing serves buyers, purchasing managers and requesters: suppliers, internal
purchase requests, sourcing, purchase orders and agreements, replenishment, receiving and
supplier returns, bill exceptions and supplier performance. A small business can carry a
purchase through settlement from contextual shared records; larger organizations separate
requesting, buying, receiving, matching and payment authority.

**Inputs.** [research-purchasing.md](research-purchasing.md) §1–§13,
[initial-design.md](initial-design.md), [design-doc-guide.md](design-doc-guide.md),

[design-drawers-commons.md](design-drawers-commons.md), [ss-inventory.md](ss-inventory.md)
and [usl-inventory.md](usl-inventory.md); the decisions of [impl-purchasing.md](impl-purchasing.md) §4 and the
shared rules of [impl-drawers-commons.md](impl-drawers-commons.md) §4 (organization filters, parties by role, changes
by effective date and the audit log). Current source governs claims of implemented behavior.
All additions explicitly marked proposed are documentation, not implemented APIs.

**Source convention.** Baseline paths are relative to
`runtime/components/addon/mr-marble/screen/SimpleScreens/`; Mantle paths are relative to
`runtime/components/addon/mr-mantle/`. Third-party references start at
`~/work/moquiwork/3p_other/`. Source files were inspected locally; third-party behavior is a
reference pattern, not an assumption about BOSS availability.

## 1. Shell

Root `screen/Purchasing.xml`, path `Purchasing`, icon `sym_o_shopping_cart`, uses
`BOSS_PURCHASING` and existing `mantle.party.PartyServices.setup#UserOrganizationInfo`.
The root and placeholders exist; the artifact group has only the admin authz, and the root user group's
authz comes with impl-purchasing P1.
This design does not claim that Purchasing is implemented. As in Products, `BOSS_PURCHASING` is both the root user
group and the artifact group, with the service checks below. The Purchasing groups take the organization filters
`MANTLE_USER_ORG` and `MANTLE_PRIVATE_CONTACT`; `BOSS_PURCHASING_ADMIN`, with all authz on the root, takes
`MANTLE_ACTIVE_ORG` and `MANTLE_PRIVATE_CONTACT` (impl-drawers-commons §4; impl-purchasing §4). Nothing filters
OrderHeader, Request, Agreement or ProductPrice, so Purchasing reads and writes them only through services that check
the buying organization, supplier, record and capability (impl-purchasing §2).

Proposed capabilities separate **requester**, **buyer**, **planner**, **purchase approver**, **receiver**,
**inspector**, **match operator**, **finance approver/payer**, **report reader** and **purchase
administrator**. `app` below means authorized purchasing read access. Requesters see their
own or assigned requests; buyers see their buying organizations and the suppliers in scope: any
Supplier-role party whose owner passes the active or available organization filter, or shared `_NA_`, with no
SupplierProfile required (impl-purchasing §4); receiver/inspector grants confer warehouse actions on the shared mounts. AP approval/payment,
bank-detail change and authorized soft-lock exception require their own financial authority; there is no bypass of a hard-closed period. A buyer's app
context cannot grant those rights or disclose another organization's prices. Every transition,
export, job and direct service call enforces record, organization, field and action access.

The capability terms of this file map to proposed groups as below. Crosscut §1 holds the one
table of capability groups for all apps (D22); this is Purchasing's part of it. Purchasing owns
six of the first seven; the match operator is Accounting's. The others are borrowed: a user who
holds one gets the action on the Purchasing mount without the owning app's root grant.

| Capability | Owner | Proposed group | What it allows here |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| requester | Purchasing | `BOSS_PURCHASING_REQUESTER` | Create and submit own purchase requests |
| buyer | Purchasing | `BOSS_PURCHASING_BUYER` | Source, award, create and send POs, revise orders, authorize supplier returns; upload supplier bills for POs of their organizations through Accounting's `import#Bill` |
| planner | Purchasing | `BOSS_PURCHASING_PLANNER` | Run SupplyPlanning, edit reorder rules and the plan schedule, convert buy suggestions |
| purchase approver | Purchasing | `BOSS_PURCHASING_APPROVE` | Decide request, award, PO and supplier approvals |
| match operator | Accounting | Accounting's `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_MATCH`, the one match group; buyers who match bills are given it, and AP includes it (D4) | Evaluate and apply bill matches; request a hold release |
| report reader | Purchasing | `BOSS_PURCHASING_READ` | Read Purchasing lists and reports |
| purchase administrator | Purchasing | `BOSS_PURCHASING_ADMIN` | Edit purchasing policies, approval policies and request purposes |
| receiver, inspector | Warehouse | Warehouse receive and inspect groups | Receive on the shared ShipmentDetail; record inspections |
| quality administrator | Warehouse (shared quality) | the shared quality-administrator group | Edit inspection template drafts |
| supplier-price editor, price reader | Products | Products supplier-price groups | Edit supplier prices; read restricted prices |
| AP intake | Accounting | `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_AP` | Create a draft bill from a PO or receipt; upload bills through `import#Bill`, which takes a buyer's upload as well (impl-accounting §4) |
| finance approver, payer | Accounting | `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_APPROVE`, `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_TREASURY` | Release holds (AP places them), approve payables, pay, edit bank details and supplier terms |
| financial reader, lease reader | Accounting | `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_READ` | Read supplier statements, payment summaries and lease schedules |
| supplier capability | external (crosscut §5) | a PASS public account bound to the supplier, or a record-bound token; no UserGroup (no `BOSS_SUPPLIER_PORTAL`) | Supplier pages in the PASS Supplier app only |

A contextual reader is a user who reaches a shared record through a link they may already read;
it is not a group.

- Home — `Home`
- Suppliers — `Suppliers`
  - Supplier record — `Supplier360`; Supplier prices — `SupplierPrices`; Price explanation — `PriceExplain`
  - Product record — `Product360`, opened from the palette's product lookup or from any product link
- Purchase requests — `Requests`
  - Request record — `RequestDetail`; Source selected demand — `RequestSourcing`
- Sourcing — `QuoteRequests`, titled "RFQs" in the menu
  - RFQ record — `QuoteRequestDetail`; Supplier quotes — `Quotes`; Compare — `QuoteComparison`; Award — `Award`
- Purchase orders — `PurchaseOrders`
  - Order record — `OrderDetail`; Changes — `OrderChanges`; Acknowledgements — `Acknowledgements`
- Approvals — `Approvals` (request, award, PO and supplier approvals)

  - Purchase history — `PurchaseHistory`; Supplier statement — `SupplierStatement`
- Settings — `Settings`
  - Buying policies — `PurchasePolicy`; Approvals — `ApprovalPolicies`; Scorecard policies — `ScorecardPolicies`
  - Inspection templates — `InspectionTemplates`

The supplier pages (`SupplierHome`, `QuoteResponse`, `OrderAcknowledgement` and Accounting's
`SupplierBillUpload`) are not in this menu or in mr-boss. They are pages of the PASS Supplier app in mr-pass
(§13; impl-purchasing §4, which reverses D5's SupplierPortal root).

**Placeholders and path convention.** Each menu section is a directory under
`screen/Purchasing/` whose default subscreen is the section's list: `Sourcing` (list
`QuoteRequests`), `Orders` (`PurchaseOrders`), `Receiving` (`Receipts`), `Replenishment`
(`SupplyPlanning`), `Performance` (`Scorecards`). A section with one list uses the list as the
parent (`Suppliers`, `Requests`, `Agreements`, `Returns`, `Bills`, `Approvals`, `Settings`). One exception:
InspectionTemplates keeps its path `Purchasing/Receiving/InspectionTemplates`, beside the inspections it
configures, while its menu entry is under Settings. The existing `Quotes.xml`
placeholder is renamed `Sourcing.xml`. New placeholders are `Agreements.xml`, `Receiving.xml`,
`Bills.xml`, `Products.xml` and `Approvals.xml`. The design names these files; the screen XML is
changed when Purchasing is built.

Home counts my unsourced requests, RFQs due, quotes to compare, quotes expiring within the
policy's warning days, unconverted buy suggestions (shortfalls) with the plan's freshness,
approvals waiting, unacknowledged POs, late receipts and blocked bills. Each opens the same filtered worklist;
held amounts, committed spend and paid amounts are distinct. Worklists preserve query and
selection on back navigation. Empty lists offer permitted creation; loading/failure shows no
invented zero totals; access-limited fields are omitted or explicitly unavailable. Amounts use
decimal currency arithmetic and quantities retain the order, purchase-pack and stock UOM.

All Purchasing screens use XML widgets, including comparison as a split plus lists. Desktop
supports dense keyboard-oriented work; phones stack the same sections. The terminal offers
find/list/detail, numbered row selection and explicit confirmation for every action; comparison
selects a demand line then lists offers in normalized units. No browser-only drag or hover is
required. Shared handheld receiving/inspection follows Warehouse's one-task/scan/confirm
interaction and the same posting services. Online-first operations reconcile operation IDs
before retry after a timeout; a resubmitted form never assumes the earlier transaction failed. The operation record
is Accounting's CX-POSTING record, keyed by `operationKey`, which Purchasing shares (impl-accounting §4).

Shell providers add authorized PO/RFQ/supplier lookup, a product lookup that opens
Purchasing's Product360 mount, quick create for request/RFQ/PO, Today items for due
requests/quotes/acknowledgements, and proposed supplier response, late receipt and
match-exception notification topics. They reuse Commons notifications, Chatter, record files,
activities and calendars. Source-record decisions power both local Approvals and Commons'
inbox; no second generic workflow engine is introduced.

The approval topics are proposed `PurchaseRequestApproval`, `PurchaseAwardApproval`,
`PurchaseOrderApproval` and `PurchaseSupplierApproval` (D8; R-PUR-14, R-PUR-15). Each topic's
approve handler is proposed `mantle.order.PurchaseServices.approve#PurchaseSource` and
its refuse handler is proposed `mantle.order.PurchaseServices.refuse#PurchaseSource`.
Both wrap the proposed `decide#PurchaseApproval`. Commons passes recordEntityName and recordId; the message
carries `messageJson.sourceRevision`, `policyVersion` (the effective-dated policy row it was evaluated against) and
`decisionStepId`. A handler refuses a stale revision and names the current one. An agreement's activation is
approved on PurchaseOrderApproval, with the agreement as source (impl-purchasing §4). The topic seed note belongs in
design-drawers-commons §4.
Needs **PUR-ACCESS**, **PUR-SHELL**, **PUR-APPROVAL**.

## 2. Screens

Paths below are proposed mounted routes. A shared screen is defined once by its owner;
its context blocks below specify only Purchasing's filters, tabs and action set. `later` rows
are intentionally designed beyond the first release, with their dependencies stated.

The four supplier rows are pages of the PASS Supplier app in mr-pass (`screen/Supplier.xml`, the `supplier` mount),
which Accounting starts with BillUpload and Purchasing extends; they are not under the Purchasing root or any BOSS
root (impl-purchasing §4, reversing D5). `SupplierHome` is the app's home at `PASS: Supplier/Home`, and
`SupplierBillUpload` keeps the shared screen's name at `PASS: Supplier/BillUpload`.

## 3. Home and suppliers

### Home

**Layout.** landing; counters above my-work lists. The page is useful with only Purchasing access.

**Forms.**

| Form | Kind | Purpose | Highlighted fields | Widgets of note | Services | Derived from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BuyerCounters | display | Summarize authorized exceptions | unsourced, quote due, quotes expiring within N days, shortfall suggestions (unconverted buy suggestions, with plan freshness), approval, unacknowledged, late, held | count links with saved filters | proposed `ironstone.purchasing.BuyerServices.get#Home` | Carbon purchasing index; Odoo purchase dashboard |
| SpendSummary | list, read | Show recent committed and billed spend without combining measures | period, committed amount, billed amount, currency, snapshot date | drill to Spend; XML table first | proposed `ironstone.purchasing.ReportServices.get#PurchaseSpend` | ERPNext Buying workspace cards/charts |
| BuyerWork | list | Prioritize assigned demand and follow-ups | document, supplier, owner, due date, amount, next action | links to contextual records | proposed `ironstone.purchasing.BuyerServices.find#BuyerWork` | ERPNext Buying workspace; Carbon buyer work queue |

**Actions and states.** Spend trends use an accessible period table initially; shared Insights chart widgets are later presentation over the same query. Counts and rows use identical authorization and filters. Quick create opens Requests, QuoteRequests or PurchaseOrders. The shortfall counter opens SupplyPlanning filtered to unconverted buy suggestions; it shows the run date, so a stale plan is not read as no shortfall. The quotes-expiring counter uses the warning days in PurchasePolicy. A refresh failure retains the dated last result with an error; no action uses cached stock/approval state.



**Source.** research §1; Carbon `carbon/apps/erp/app/routes/x+/purchasing+/_index.tsx`; Odoo `odoo/odoo/addons/purchase/static/src/views/purchase_dashboard.xml`; ERPNext `frappe/erpnext/erpnext/buying/workspace/buying/buying.json`.

**Needs.** PUR-SHELL, PUR-ACCESS.

### Suppliers

**Layout.** list with find header and create dialogs.

**Forms.**

| Form | Kind | Purpose | Highlighted fields | Widgets of note | Services | Derived from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SupplierFind | find | Find authorized external supplier | name, ID, classification, buyer, active/risk, country | server party lookup | none | Supplier/FindSupplier OuterSearchForm |
| SupplierList | list | Show sourcing readiness and balances where allowed | supplier, contact, buyer, approval status, currency, open PO, risk | Supplier360 links | `mantle.party.PartyServices.find#Party`; proposed `ironstone.purchasing.SupplierServices.find#Suppliers` | Supplier/FindSupplier SupplierListForm; Carbon Supplier list |
| CreateSupplierPerson | dialog | Create an individual supplier | first/last name, email, phone, external ID | existing contact widgets | `mantle.party.PartyServices.create#Person`; `mantle.party.PartyServices.ensure#PartyRole` | Supplier/FindSupplier CreatePersonForm |
| CreateSupplierOrganization | dialog | Create a business supplier | organization name, external ID, contact, classifications | duplicate search before create | `mantle.party.PartyServices.create#Organization`; `mantle.party.PartyServices.ensure#PartyRole` | Supplier/FindSupplier CreateOrganizationForm |

**Actions and states.** Create requires supplier edit permission and adds the Supplier role, owned by the active organization; duplicate candidates open existing Supplier360. A buyer may buy from any Supplier-role party in scope (§1) without a SupplierProfile (impl-purchasing §4). When PurchasePolicy requires supplier approval, a new supplier's proposed SupplierProfile starts Pending and a PurchaseSupplierApproval notification goes to the purchase approver (R-PUR-15). Disable sourcing is a dated supplier policy, not deleting Party or silently cancelling existing POs. Bulk owner/classification changes report supplier-ID failures independently.



**Source.** research §2; baseline Supplier/FindSupplier and Party/EditParty; Carbon `carbon/apps/erp/app/modules/purchasing/ui/Supplier/SupplierForm.tsx`.

**Needs.** PUR-SUPPLIER, PUR-ACCESS.

### Supplier360

**Shared maps (proposed, CX-MAPS):** supplier address fields and drop-ship facility links use the local-map dialog in
[crosscut §3.32](design-crosscut.md#332-maps-and-record-location-dialogs), with full-screen Maps available for context.
Postal-area fallback is labeled approximate; supplier/contact/facility permissions govern every location returned.
Purchase-order and receipt address blocks use their transaction snapshot, and map selection cannot bypass the
owning contact edit or purchase-order change rules.

**Context passed.** Mount `Purchasing/Suppliers/Supplier360`; [crosscut §3.3](design-crosscut.md#33-supplier360). Fix external supplier and authenticated buying organization. Tabs: Overview/contact, Products/prices, RFQs/quotes, Agreements, Purchase orders, Receipts/quality, Returns, Bills/payment summary, Payment details, Identifications and tax registrations, Performance, Chatter/files. Buyers edit sourcing terms, classifications, buyer and supplier status; finance alone changes bank/payment details. Supplier profile defaults are organization-specific; global Party contact changes need Party authority. Use existing Party/FinancialInfo financial summaries only with financial read capability. Proposed SupplierProfile is effective-dated rows by organization and supplier, with its key fields audit-logged: default currency/terms/incoterm, the dated purchase block with its reason, and approval status; a change ends the current row and starts the next, and the profile's history comes from its rows and the audit log. The supplier's buyer is a dated PartyRelationship from the buyer (Buyer) to the supplier (Supplier), not a profile field (impl-purchasing §4; impl-drawers-commons §4).

Supplier360 also offers Invite to the Supplier app, the PASS invitation of §13, and a purchase administrator sees the supplier's drop-ship facility and its remote (§6 Drop-ship). The shared Supplier360 forms PaymentDetails, PartyIdentifications and TaxRegistrations (crosscut §3.3; D26) show here. PaymentDetails is finance-gated and masked. It writes through `mantle.account.PaymentMethodServices.create#BankAccount` and `update#BankAccount` behind the finance guard, and a change voids any pending payment-run approval for the supplier. TaxRegistrations is finance-gated; PartyIdentifications follows Party authority. Default payment terms stay on the SupplierProfile (built, Accounting P6), and only finance edits them, through `mantle.party.SupplierServices.store#SupplierProfile` (built, Accounting P6) with a finance-capability check on the terms fields. Finance also sets `SupplierProfile.selfBillingIndicator` (built, Accounting P6), which lets the receipt bill SECA run for that supplier (D2; §10 Bills). Buyers see both values read-only.

`SupplierProfile.approvalStatusId` (StatusType `SupplierApproval`: Pending, Approved, Rejected, Suspended; built in impl-purchasing P2 with the currency, Incoterm and dated purchase block) records supplier onboarding (R-PUR-15); `mantle.order.PurchaseServices.check#SupplierUsable` answers OK, WARN or STOP from it and the buying policy. Submitting a Pending supplier for approval sends a PurchaseSupplierApproval notification through the same approval handlers as purchase documents (§6 Approvals). An RFQ or PO to a supplier that is not Approved gets the Warn or Stop result set in PurchasePolicy. Suspended works like the dated purchase block and keeps its reason.

### SupplierPrices

**Context passed.** Mount `Purchasing/Suppliers/SupplierPrices`; [Products §8](design-products.md#8-suppliers) and crosscut §3.21. Include the Products-owned supplier-price screen at physical `Shared/SupplierPrices.xml` with supplier fixed when entered from Supplier360. Only purchase-direction ProductPrice rows: vendorPartyId is external supplier, customerPartyId is internal buying organization or a permitted generic scope. Tabs/actions: dated tiers, supplier code/name, lead time, MOQ/increment, packaging, preferred source, agreement, import. `priceUomId` is currency; quantityUomId is quantity unit. Resolver is existing `mantle.product.PriceServices.get#ProductPrice` with the shared proposed rule/trace extension. Writes are ProductPrice entity create and update through Products' proposed guarded supplier-price mutation, `mantle.product.PriceServices.store#ProductPrice` (Products §8; R-PRD-05). Existing `modify#ProductPrice` is the resolver's price-modifier interface; only the price-rule extension reuses it (R-PUR-04). No duplicate supplier-product price table.

Dimensional units such as kg or each may appear in `quantityUomId`. A product-specific pack such as a case of 12 is a pack product linked by `PatPackagingFor`, not a global UOM conversion (crosscut §4.1; R-SA-14). A purchase in cases orders the pack product, or the base product in base units; Warehouse converts pack to base at receipt. Purchasing mounts only SupplierPrices and PriceExplain. It opens PriceLists by link, for a user with the price-policy grant (R-XC-23). Source: Catalog/Product/EditPrices NewPriceForm/PricesForm. Needs **PUR-SUPPLIER**, **CX-PRICING**.

### Product360

**Context passed.** Mount `Purchasing/Products/Product360`; [crosscut §3.5](design-crosscut.md#35-product360). Fix product/variant; tabs: identity, units/barcodes/packaging, supplier prices, purchase history, availability, specifications/documents and BOM links if granted. The purchase-history and BOM tabs are in the crosscut row (§17, Shared-screen rows). Buyer can choose an actual SKU and authorized substitute, never silently order a virtual parent. A product that Products' `mantle.product.ProductServices.check#ProductUsable` refuses for buying shows the lifecycle reason and offers no order action (D19). Product master edit, BOM change and cost edit retain their separate grants. Needs **CX-PRICING**, **CX-AVAILABILITY**.

### PriceExplain

**Context passed.** Mount `Purchasing/Suppliers/PriceExplain`; [crosscut §3.21](design-crosscut.md#321-price-lists-and-explanation). Use physical `Shared/PriceExplain.xml` with Products design ownership; pass product, external vendor, internal customer, quantity/UOM, currency, effective date and optional agreement. Show rule candidates, exclusions, conversions, selected tier, minimum/increment and override reason. Access checks hide another supplier's restricted cost/quote. Existing `OrderItem.productPriceId` and `isModifiedPrice` already record the selected price row and an override, and `unitListPrice` the list price; the proposed trace adds rule and version detail (R-PUR-32). Changing a supplier-price row cannot retroactively reprice a placed PO. Needs **CX-PRICING**.

## 4. Purchase requests

### Requests

**Layout.** list with My requests, Awaiting sourcing, Due and All authorized saved filters.

**Forms.**

| Form | Kind | Purpose | Highlighted fields | Widgets of note | Services | Derived from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RequestFind | find | Filter internal purchase demand | request ID, requester, buyer, status, required date, facility | date-period | none | Request/FindRequest ListRequests filters |
| RequestList | list | Show requested versus sourced quantities | request, requester, facility, due, approval, sourced/remaining | status and source links | proposed `ironstone.purchasing.RequestServices.find#PurchaseRequests` | Request/FindRequest ListRequests; ERPNext Material Request |
| NewPurchaseRequest | dialog | Capture internal demand | name/purpose, buying organization (a RequestParty in the OrgInternal role), project, facility, response date, currency, requester; the cost centre (proposed, Accounting AC-22) is on each line | product lines in RequestDetail after save | `mantle.request.RequestServices.create#Request` with RqtPurchase | Request/FindRequest NewRequestForm |

**Actions and states.** Requester creates a draft and edits own permitted requests; buyer assigns, reviews and sources. Request list follows RequestDetail access even in batch actions. Bulk submit reports request-specific failures; it does not bypass the source approval policy.



**Source.** research §3; Request/FindRequest; ERPNext `frappe/erpnext/erpnext/stock/doctype/material_request/material_request.json`.

**Needs.** PUR-REQUEST, PUR-ACCESS.

### RequestDetail

**Context passed.** Mount `Purchasing/Requests/RequestDetail`; [Projects §6](design-projects.md#6-requests) and [crosscut §3.11](design-crosscut.md#311-requestdetail). Fix requestTypeEnumId=RqtPurchase, buying organization and permitted requester/assignment scope. Tabs: Overview, Items, Sourcing progress (the crosscut §3.11 PurchaseSourcingProgress form, loaded by proposed `mantle.request.RequestServices.get#PurchaseRequestProgress`), Approval (the crosscut §3.11 PurchaseRequestApproval form), related work/users/wiki links, Chatter/files. Use existing create/update#Request, replace#RequestParty and link/unlink#RequestRecord services in mantle.request.RequestServices; item CRUD derives from Request/EditRequestItems. Purpose uses existing Request.requestCategoryId/RequestCategory; project uses existing rootWorkEffortId or an authorized record link. The commitment's budget item comes from the line's GL account (the item type mapping or existing `OrderItem.overrideGlAccountId`) plus period; cost center and project become commitment dimensions only if Accounting adds them, and existing `RequirementBudgetAllocation` may be written as a link, not as the commitment (R-PUR-07; D10). Items retain productId, quantity, requiredByDate, maximumAmount, selectedAmount and supplierPartyId; proposed quantityUomId and a cost centre per line, carried to `OrderItem.costCenterId`, extend them for unit-safe approvals. The request's organization is a RequestParty in the OrgInternal role, and the filer stays `Request.filedByPartyId`. RequestItem's product, quantity, unit, required date, supplier and cost centre are audit-logged, so the request's revision is the time of its last change to them, and a decision is refused if the request changed after it (impl-purchasing §4; impl-drawers-commons §4). Shared Request status IDs remain ReqDraft, ReqSubmitted, ReqReviewed, ReqInProgress, ReqCompleted, ReqCancelled; Reviewed is triage, not financial approval. Submit invokes revision-bound purchase decision/commitment checks; source demand only after approval when policy requires it. Request cancellation releases unsourced demand, flags linked POs for an explicit cancellation decision and preserves history. Completed means quantity is fulfilled or explicitly closed with a reason; RFQ/PO issuance alone is In Progress.

In every app context the base RequestItems "Create purchase order" action opens `Purchasing/Requests/RequestSourcing` (R-PUR-01). The action is absent for a user without the buyer capability. No context calls `mantle.order.OrderServices.create#PurchaseRequestOrder` directly, because it sources every item again on each call, fails the whole request on one missing supplier and can place and approve POs. The BOSS guard in RequestSourcing rejects `placeAndApproveOrders=true` and quantities that are already sourced. The matching edits to Projects §6 RequestItems and crosscut §3.11 belong to those files.

Approval follows the PurchaseRequestApproval topic (§1; D8). Approving an RqtPurchase item creates or links one Requirement through the existing `RequirementRequestItem`, with type RqTpProduct for a product line or RqTpInternal otherwise, status RqmtStApproved, its organization as a RequirementParty in the OrgInternal role, and the proposed Requirement quantityUomId of crosscut §3.20 (R-PUR-06; R-SA-15; impl-purchasing §4). The same approval calls Accounting's `mantle.other.BudgetServices.reserve#Commitment` (built, Accounting P15) for the request revision (D10). Refusing leaves the request ReqSubmitted with a refused PurchaseApprovalDecision; Request has no Rejected status. Cancelling the request calls `release#Commitment` (built, Accounting P15) for the unsourced remainder.

**As built (impl-purchasing P10).** A request's revision is the time of its lines' last audit-logged change; a line is
removed only from a draft. Its amount for the approval bands and the request-stage commitment is the lines'
`maximumAmount`, the most to pay for each line, in the request's currency (no supplier price before sourcing). The last
step's approval makes the requirements, reserves the commitment and puts the request In Progress (Request has no Approved
status, and Reviewed is triage); a refusal leaves it Submitted. Nothing completes it yet when its lines are received.

**Maintenance purchases (Nov 1, 2026; review R-MNT-06).** A request raised from maintenance work shows the originating work order in the Overview, read from the request's link to the work (`RequestWorkEffort`, or the record link Maintenance's `link#MaintenancePurchase` writes), with a link to it in Maintenance. Outside maintenance service on the resulting PO is accepted through `accept#ServiceItem`, called from Maintenance's CompleteWork with the work's evidence. Buyers see the work's identity and need date, not its internal notes. As built (impl-maintenance P10): RequestDetail shows "From work order" under the header for each work order the request is linked to (`mantle.work.MaintenanceServices.get#PurchaseRequestWork`, for a reader of the request under this app's rule): its id, target, status and need date, with its name and a link to WorkOrderDetail only for a user Maintenance admits (impl-maintenance P10 review); the request services and their specs are unchanged. The request is filed by Maintenance through `create#PurchaseRequest` (the planner its requester), and when a line is sourced its order line is linked to the work's equipment record by Maintenance's entity ECA on RequestItemOrder; sourcing itself is unchanged.

`complete#RequestFromWork` does nothing for RqtPurchase and the proposed RqtPurchaseRfq; their progress comes from `get#PurchaseRequestProgress` (R-XC-40). Projects linked-work completion therefore never completes a purchasing or inventory request. An RFQ request (RqtPurchaseRfq) never opens in this mount; it routes to QuoteRequestDetail (R-PUR-13). Needs **PUR-REQUEST**, **PUR-APPROVAL**, **PUR-BUDGET**.

### RequestSourcing

**Layout.** wizard: select demand, choose route/supplier, review supplier groups, results.

**Forms.**

| Form | Kind | Purpose | Highlighted fields | Widgets of note | Services | Derived from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SourceDemand | wizard step | Choose uncovered approved lines | request/item, required qty, previously sourced, remaining, facility, date | row selection with lineage | proposed `mantle.request.RequestServices.preview#PurchaseSourcing` | Request/EditRequestItems RequestItemListForm; ERPNext Material Request sourcing |
| SourceGroups | wizard step | Review RFQ or direct-PO allocation | supplier, route, quantity/UOM, price/override, due, agreement, source revision | editable group list; PriceExplain link | proposed `mantle.request.RequestServices.preview#PurchaseSourcing` | ERPNext Material Request Make; existing create#PurchaseRequestOrder |
| ConvertDemand | wizard step | Create one transaction per independent supplier group | operation ID, group ID, source revision, selected allocations, results | confirmation; named retry rows | proposed `mantle.request.RequestServices.convert#PurchaseSourcing`, in place of `mantle.order.OrderServices.create#PurchaseRequestOrder`, which stays unchanged for its Mantle callers (impl-purchasing F4) | OrderServices.create#PurchaseRequestOrder service; Request/EditRequestItems source items; ERPNext Material Request |

**Actions and states.** Preview checks source approval, supplier block and approval status, product usability through Products' `check#ProductUsable` (D19), price, UOM and budget policy through Accounting's `BudgetServices.check#Budget` (D10). Commit rechecks and locks remaining RequestItem/Requirement allocations and creates the PO plus lineage atomically per supplier group. Every PO or award line created from an approved request item records proposed `RequirementSupply` against that item's Requirement and an existing `RequestItemOrder` row; the conversion lock is on the Requirement's remaining quantity, so SupplyPlanning sees the demand as covered and cannot convert it again (R-PUR-06). The service never passes `placeAndApproveOrders=true` and refuses a request item whose quantity is already sourced (R-PUR-01). Draft POs stay OrderOpen; placing and approving are separate steps. MissingSupplier on request/item A does not discard valid supplier B; results name supplier, source lines, document, success/failure and retry operation. Retry only failed groups; existing successes return their document IDs. Customer demand may take the drop-ship route, moving the sales line to the supplier's drop-ship facility (§6 Drop-ship). An RFQ's requested quotes do not consume committed supply. A purchase quote can originate without an internal request; the same explicit provenance rules apply when subsequently ordered.

As built (impl-purchasing P10): a line is priced at the supplier's price the buyer may read, and a group with no price
fails PRICE_UNAVAILABLE (no per-line override yet); the preview carries no budget check, since the request's budget was
decided at its approval and the order stage at the PO's (`convert#Commitment`).

**Fields for new result envelope.** `operationId`, `supplierGroupId`, `supplierPartyId`, `sourceRevision`, `requestItemKeys`, `requirementIds`, `requestedQuantity`, `allocatedQuantity`, `quantityUomId`, `resultStatus`, `orderId`, `orderPartSeqId`, `rfqRequestId`, `errorCode`, `errorMessage`, `retryable`. Each group retains its own completed result; no global success label on mixed results.

**Source.** research §3, §6; active service/mantle/order/OrderServices.xml create#PurchaseRequestOrder groups by supplier but returns scalar orderId/orderPartSeqId, returns early if any supplier is missing, and does not expose per-group outcomes. It is not already the batch contract specified here.

**Needs.** PUR-REQUEST, PUR-RFQ, PUR-BUDGET.

### QuoteRequests

**Layout.** list with response-deadline filters and create dialog.

**Forms.**

**Actions and states.** Create uses proposed RqtPurchaseRfq, never customer-facing RqtQuote. Open QuoteRequestDetail; clone drafts copies only reusable specifications/terms, not prior quote orders or their capabilities, quote decisions or supply links.

**Needs.** PUR-RFQ, PUR-ACCESS.

### QuoteRequestDetail

**Layout.** detail with Items, Invited suppliers, Responses, Award progress and Chatter/files tabs.

**Forms.**

| Form | Kind | Purpose | Highlighted fields | Widgets of note | Services | Derived from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| QuoteRequestHeader | single | Maintain solicitation revision | name, buyer, organization, deadline, currency, shipping/billing address, terms | status bar | proposed `mantle.order.SourcingServices.store#QuoteRequest` | ERPNext RFQ header; Request/EditRequest EditRequest |

| QuoteRequestResponses | list, read | Review offers and awarded balance | supplier, quote, received date, validity, response status, award qty | QuoteComparison and QuoteDetail links | proposed `ironstone.purchasing.SourcingServices.get#QuoteRequest` | Carbon RFQ responses |

**Actions and states.** Draft edits are free within permission. The RFQ and its items are audit-logged as a purchase request's are; send publishes the RFQ as of its time and stores the published RFQ's PDF as RequestContent, stamped with that time. A material edit after it is a new revision, invalidates old unaccepted award previews, and requires a new explicit send; the earlier RFQ prints as of its send time. Cancel/reopen keep the history in the audit log and revoke or replace the quote orders' capabilities. Request lifecycle remains existing Req* states: published solicitation is Submitted, reviewed offers Reviewed, active award fulfillment InProgress, completed/closed demand Completed. Approval decisions and supplier-response states are separate. Sending to one invalid contact yields InvitationDeliveryFailed for that supplier and continues other recipients; the result does not mark unsent quote requests sent.

**Request-type policy.** RqtPurchaseRfq is excluded from Commons, Projects and Customer Service request lists and from every RequestDetail mount (R-PUR-13). Its request-type policy turns off generic triage, work-link completion and Convert to project, because Submitted here means published and Reviewed means offers reviewed. Every open of an RFQ request, from any link or the palette, routes to `Purchasing/Sourcing/QuoteRequestDetail`. The policy belongs to CX-REQUEST and PUR-RFQ.

**Data contract** (impl-purchasing §4; F19). Each invited supplier's quote is a purchase OrderHeader with one part, the supplier as vendor and the buying organization as customer, in OrderRequested ("Request Quote"), its lines from the RFQ items with RequestItemOrder links; there is no invitation record. Send creates the quote order's capability through proposed `mantle.party.ExternalAccessServices.create#AccessCapability` (record, revision, supplier, scope `QuoteResponse`, expiry) and mails its link, the PASS Supplier app's QuoteResponse page taking the token, on the buying organization's site (crosscut §5; §13). Cancel, a new revision or the award's close step revokes it through `revoke#AccessCapability`. A proposed source-allocation relation links request items/requirements to RFQ items with quantity/UOM; requested and proposed quotes never reserve stock or count as incoming supply. Public documents exclude internal maximum prices, competing suppliers and private source-request notes.

As built (impl-purchasing P11): the source-allocation relation is RequestItemAssoc, from the RFQ item to the purchase
request line, with the quantity left to source when the RFQ was made; the recipients are the supplier's order addresses,
else its primary ones, and the deadline is the RFQ's (a per-supplier contact, channel and deadline are later, F-P11-6); an
invitation's send state is its quote order's emails against the RFQ's revision. Commons and Projects leave the type out of
their lists and request access; `convert#RequestToProject` refuses it.

**Source.** research §4; ERPNext request_for_quotation JSON/JS; Carbon PurchasingRFQForm and `carbon/apps/erp/app/routes/share+/purchasing-rfq.$id.tsx`; active Request/RequestItem source.

### Quotes

**Layout.** list across RFQ responses and supplier-initiated offers.

**Forms.**

| Form | Kind | Purpose | Highlighted fields | Widgets of note | Services | Derived from |

| QuoteFind | find | Filter supplier offers | supplier, RFQ, buyer, product, valid date, state | date-period | none | ERPNext Supplier Quotation list |

**Actions and states.** A supplier quote is a purchase OrderHeader in OrderRequested or OrderProposed, and an unsolicited one is entered straight in OrderProposed (impl-purchasing §4). Buyers may enter on behalf of a supplier with provenance/channel and evidence, before the supplier pages exist and after (§13); received supplier submissions remain distinguishable. Expired (past `OrderPart.validThruDate`)/rejected/superseded quotes are visible history but ineligible for award without a new supplier-confirmed revision.

### QuoteDetail

**Layout.** detail with Lines/tiers, Terms, Evidence and Award links.

**Forms.**

| Form | Kind | Purpose | Highlighted fields | Widgets of note | Services | Derived from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| QuoteHeader | single | Maintain supplier offer evidence | supplier/reference (`OrderPart.otherPartyOrderId`), status, quote date, valid from/thru (`OrderPart.validFromDate`, `validThruDate`), currency, terms (`settlementTermId`, `tradeTermEnumId`), delivery, source channel | record files; history from the audit log | proposed `mantle.order.SourcingServices.store#SupplierQuote` | ERPNext Supplier Quotation header |
| QuoteLines | list, editable rows | Record offered specification and price breaks on the quote order's lines | RFQ/source line, product, supplier code, offered qty/UOM, lead days, unit price, substitute | quantity tiers (below); line history; Product360 | proposed `mantle.order.SourcingServices.store#SupplierQuoteItem` | Carbon SupplierQuoteLinePricing; ERPNext Supplier Quotation Item |

| QuoteAwards | list, read | Trace accepted portions | allocated quantity, placed line, RequirementSupply, remaining, cancelled as Not awarded | source links | proposed `ironstone.purchasing.SourcingServices.get#SupplierQuote` | Carbon SupplierQuoteToOrderDrawer |
| PublishPrice | dialog | Publish a negotiated quote price as an effective supplier price | quote line or tier, quote order and revision, effective from/thru, agreement, minimum quantity, currency | confirmation with the price row it creates or ends | proposed `mantle.order.SourcingServices.publish#SupplierQuotePrice` | ERPNext Supplier Quotation; Products §8 supplier-price store |

**Actions and states.** Validate units and supplier identity before accepting a submitted offer. An amendment is an audit-logged change to the quote order, read back as of any time; once an award places the quote it is a PO and changes only through OrderChanges. Buyer may reject with reason; retraction cannot delete a linked PO. PublishPrice is the only path from a quote to a supplier price (R-PUR-21). It needs the supplier-price editor capability. Proposed `publish#SupplierQuotePrice` writes the ProductPrice row through Products' proposed `mantle.product.PriceServices.store#ProductPrice`, preserves effective dates, and records the source order and line on the row. An offer is not inventory supply or a binding PO. Quote evidence files are the quote order's OrderContent (D25; impl-purchasing §4).

**Quantity tiers** both ways (impl-purchasing §4; F22). As purchase ProductPrice rows with their minimum quantities, valid for the quote's validity, so the resolver prices a line at any quantity, the long-standing Moqui Java way; PublishPrice writes them, and a supplier's submitted tiers become price rows only when a buyer publishes them. Where an organization uses it, a promotion's auto-adjust: an `apply#Promotion` service adds an `isPromo` child OrderItem (`parentItemSeqId`, `promoQuantity`) for the quantity difference, reapplied by `apply#OrderPromotions` on every change. Mantle finds promotions through the order's ProductStore, which a PO lacks, so their purchase scope is checked before the build.
As built (impl-purchasing P11): tiers are price rows, PublishPrice publishing a line's price or a tier (from quantity and
price) per call, with the source order and line on the row; the promotion way needs a purchasing ProductStore and is later
(F41, F-P11-3).

### QuoteComparison

**Layout.** split: demand lines at left, normalized offers and evidence at right; no custom matrix.

**Forms.**

| Form | Kind | Purpose | Highlighted fields | Widgets of note | Services | Derived from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CompareBasis | single | Fix the comparison basis | RFQ revision, demand qty/UOM, display currency, FX date/rate source, delivery date | currency and UOM selectors | proposed `mantle.order.SourcingServices.compare#SupplierQuotes` | Carbon SupplierQuoteCompareDrawer; ERPNext Supplier Quotation Comparison |
| OfferComparison | list, read | Compare eligible supplier tiers, priced at the compared quantity by the resolver's tier rows and any promotion child items | supplier, offered product, normalized price, freight/tax estimate, lead time, on-time delivery rate from scorecard evidence, validity, risk | sort with explanation; original quote drill-in | proposed `mantle.order.SourcingServices.compare#SupplierQuotes` | Carbon SupplierQuoteCompareDrawer quantity tiers |

**Actions and states.** Compare committed offer unit prices and estimated landed cost separately. Original currency, quote conversion and timestamp remain visible; absent freight/FX or incompatible UOM is Unknown/Not comparable, not zero/cheapest. Ranking does not choose or approve a supplier. Substitute requires product/specification authority and requester acceptance where policy requires it; incompatible released BOM material is referred to Manufacturing change review.

**Devices.** Narrow browser and terminal select one demand item and then one offer list; fields/totals are identical. Keyboard row selection and explicit Add allocation replace matrix gestures. Allocation totals always show demanded, selected and remaining quantities.

### Award

**Layout.** wizard: validate selected offers, review PO groups/approvals, commit and results, close the solicitation.

**Forms.**

| Form | Kind | Purpose | Highlighted fields | Widgets of note | Services | Derived from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AwardPreview | wizard step | Validate a proposed award | source revision, quote revisions, qty/UOM, supplier, price, due, budget decision | grouped list; stale source errors | proposed `mantle.order.SourcingServices.preview#Award` | Carbon SupplierQuoteToOrderDrawer |
| AwardCommit | wizard step | Place the chosen quotes as revision-bound purchase commitments | operation ID, supplier group, selected allocations, approver decision, PO results | confirmation; retry failed group | proposed `mantle.order.SourcingServices.commit#Award` | Carbon quote-to-order conversion; ERPNext Make Purchase Order |
| CloseSolicitation | wizard step | Close the losing side of the RFQ | remaining quote orders, cancelled as Not awarded, regret notice yes/no, message, recipients, per-recipient outcome | per-recipient preview; confirmation | proposed `mantle.order.SourcingServices.close#QuoteRequest`; `mantle.party.ExternalAccessServices.revoke#AccessCapability` | Odoo purchase_alternative warning wizard |

**Actions and states.** Commit locks remaining request/requirement demand and quote allocation, then, atomically per supplier group, sets each chosen quote line's quantity to its allocation (audit-logged) and places the quote order ("Place from Quote") with its RequestItemOrder/RequirementSupply links; there is no award record (impl-purchasing §4). It never auto-approves or auto-sends a PO. Double-click/retry returns existing results. QuoteExpired, SourceChanged, SupplierBlocked, BudgetStop, InvalidSubstitute and DemandAlreadyCovered identify the supplier/line; independent groups continue. Cancelling an unfulfilled PO releases remaining allocation by explicit recorded close/cancel; received/billed portions stay linked. Partial awards leave the uncovered demand available to a subsequent run. An award that needs approval sends a PurchaseAwardApproval notification and places nothing until decided; refusal leaves the quotes unplaced (D8). Preview checks the budget through Accounting's `check#Budget` and product usability through Products' `check#ProductUsable` (D10; D19). As built (impl-purchasing P12): a supplier group is one quote (one live quote per supplier and RFQ); an award needs approval where PasAward policy rows are in effect, its allocations waiting as the award's operation; the budget shows to a user who may read budgets and is otherwise decided at the PO's approval.

CloseSolicitation is the last step (R-PUR-35). It cancels each quote order without an award as Not awarded ("Cancel Quote" from OrderProposed; "Cancel Quote Request" from OrderRequested for a supplier that never answered, impl-purchasing F19, F-P12-2), revokes its capability, and optionally sends a reviewed regret notice with a per-recipient outcome. It warns when other draft POs for the same demand remain. Offers stay as history.

**Model** (impl-purchasing §4; F19). A supplier quote is the purchase OrderHeader in OrderRequested and OrderProposed, its versions are the audit log of its key fields, and an award places it. There are no separate quote, quote item, price-break or award records (§17): tiers are purchase ProductPrice rows or promotion child items (QuoteDetail), and canonical `RequirementSupply` tracks actual supply allocation against the placed lines.

**Actions and states.** Approve cannot use a stale revision or self-approval prohibited by policy. `decide#PurchaseApproval` calls Accounting's `BudgetServices.convert#Commitment` (built, Accounting P15) to turn the request reservation into a PO commitment, or `reserve#Commitment` for a PO with no request, under lock (D10; R-XC-37). Accounting's `approve#Payable` later converts the PO commitment to actual. With no active approval policy, one step by the purchase-approver capability approves, and self-approval needs an explicit policy setting (R-PUR-14). Batch orders are independent: failed PO IDs are reported while permitted orders finish. Placing, approving and sending remain separate operations. A PO has one purchase part, and its revisions, sends and acknowledgements key on the order header's revision (impl-purchasing §4, F7); each line carries its cost centre in `OrderItem.costCenterId` (built, Accounting P6).

Close remainder is explicit and has one owner, `close#PurchaseRemainders`, whichever app starts it (R-PUR-10); Warehouse built it as Purchasing's contract (Warehouse P7; impl-warehouse §4). Warehouse's `WarehouseTaskServices.close#ReceiptRemainder` (built, Warehouse P7) delegates to it for ShpTpPurchase sources, with a reason and operationId (R-SB-11). Per item, the purchase remainder is quantity − quantityCancelled − Σ AssetReceipt (accepted + rejected), net of supplier returns per policy (R-PUR-03). The service records it on the existing `OrderItem.quantityCancelled` by calling `cancel#OrderItem` with that explicit cancelQuantity. It releases the Requirement allocation and calls `release#ClosedSourceCommitments` for the unused budget. It sets OrderCompleted only when nothing is open. Purchase parts never call `cancel#OrderItem` or `cancel#OrderPart` without an explicit cancelQuantity, because their default measures outbound AssetIssuance and would cancel the full ordered quantity after a receipt. Delivered and invoiced quantities stay.

MergeDraftPurchaseOrders is `later` (R-PUR-35). It merges OrderOpen POs with the same supplier, buying organization and currency; lines keep their RequestItemOrder and RequirementSupply links.

### OrderDetail

**Context passed.** Mount `Purchasing/Orders/OrderDetail`; [crosscut §3.6](design-crosscut.md#36-orderdetail). Filter purchase parts to vendor=external supplier and customer=authorized internal buyer. Tabs: Header/addresses/terms, Items, Sources (request, requirement, award), Approvals and revisions (each revision's time, changes and stored PDF), Acknowledgements, Receipts/inspection, Bills/match, Money (finance capability), Returns, Agreements, History (the audit log and the stored PDFs), Chatter/files. Buyer actions create/update draft header/parts/items, price explain, submit/place, approve with separate grant, send revision, hold, change (OrderChanges), cancel remaining, close, clone, print as of a date and time, and match exceptions; a user with a stock role also receives from here. The crosscut §3.6 Purchasing row has these tabs and actions (§17, Shared-screen rows; R-PUR-11). Finance handles payment/application through shared InvoiceDetail with its capability. Source baseline: Order/OrderDetail, OrderItems, PrintOrder; active `mantle.order.OrderServices.create#OrderPart`, `update#OrderHeader`, `update#OrderPart`, `create#OrderItem`, `update#OrderItem`, `delete#OrderItem`, `add#OrderProductQuantity`, `place#Order`, `approve#Order`, `update#OrderStatus`, `cancel#Order`, `cancel#OrderPart`, `cancel#OrderItem`, `complete#OrderPart`, `clone#Order`; display via `mantle.order.OrderInfoServices.get#OrderDisplayInfo`. Creating or changing an item calls Products' `check#ProductUsable` for buying (D19).

**Send.** Send revision calls proposed `mantle.order.OrderServices.send#PurchaseOrder` (R-PUR-02). In: orderId, orderPartSeqId, orderRevision, recipient contactMechIds, template, message, the PDF of the rendered revision and operationId. Recipients default to the vendor party's `EmailOrder` address, then `EmailPrimary`. It sends through `mantle.party.CommunicationServices.send#EmailDraft`, dedupes on order, revision and recipient, records the delivery outcome per recipient, and on success moves the part OrderApproved → OrderSent. The sent PDF is stored as OrderContent, stamped with the revision and its time. The PO link in the mail is the PASS Supplier app's page for the PO, taking its token; one capability covers OrderAcknowledgement and BillUpload, and a new revision or a cancel revokes it (§13; impl-purchasing §4). Mantle's `send#OrderStoreEmail` is not used for POs: it sends nothing when the order has no ProductStore, addresses the customer party (the internal buyer on a PO), and never re-sends an email type already sent, so a new revision would never go out.

**Statuses.** The order statuses are OrderBeingChanged, OrderOpen, OrderRequested, OrderProposed, OrderPlaced, OrderHold, OrderProcessing, OrderApproved, OrderSent, OrderCompleted, OrderRejected and OrderCancelled (R-PUR-05). Mantle allows OrderBeingChanged only from OrderOpen or OrderProposed, and has no OrderSent → OrderHold transition. Its un-approve (OrderApproved → OrderPlaced) runs the OrderPlaced SECAs again, so BOSS does not use it to unlock a PO. A buyer's hold and a revision lock both use OrderHold through `mantle.order.OrderServices.hold#Order` and `release#OrderHold` (built, Accounting P10), each recorded as a `mantle.order.OrderHoldReason` row with type Purchase or Change (D7; R-SB-07, R-SB-08). A Sent PO first un-sends to OrderApproved ("Approve (un-send)"), then holds. `release#OrderHold` returns the order to OrderApproved only when no other open reason remains, so Purchasing cannot release Accounting's credit hold or another app's change. Each hold type is released under its own `enumCode` permission (X4): OhtPurchase with proposed `PURCHASE_HOLD_RELEASE`, which BOSS_PURCHASING_APPROVE holds, and OhtChange with proposed `ORDER_CHANGE_HOLD_RELEASE`. `ORDER_APPROVE` no longer releases a Purchase hold. Refuse on approval moves OrderPlaced → OrderRejected. A supplier quote is a purchase order in OrderRequested and OrderProposed, and an award places it ("Place from Quote"; §5).

**Bills and money.** "Create draft bill" opens the shared InvoiceFromSource dialog of crosscut §3.6 for a user with AP intake (`BOSS_ACCOUNTING_AP`) or finance capability (D2; R-PUR-16). It calls Accounting's `mantle.account.InvoiceServices.create#InvoiceFromSource` (built, Accounting P6), either on the ordered basis (`mantle.account.InvoiceServices.create#EntireOrderPartInvoice`) or on the accepted, released received basis, behind Accounting's duplicate and source guard. It never calls `create#PurchaseShipmentInvoices` directly, because that service bills rejected and quarantined units. The Money tab (finance capability) offers "request supplier prepayment" (R-PUR-36). That creates an Accounting payment request linked to the order part through existing `mantle.order.OrderServices.add#OrderPartPayment`, and the match applies it when the bill arrives. The approval guard below keeps a covering prepayment from approving the PO on its own (R-SB-10).

**Service acceptance.** For a service or non-stock line, the Items tab offers RecordServiceAcceptance (R-PUR-09), for a receiver or for the requester named as acceptor. It records orderId and orderItemSeqId, accepted quantity and UOM, acceptance date, acceptor, an evidence file and operationId through `mantle.order.OrderServices.accept#ServiceItem` (built, Warehouse P16b), which writes `mantle.order.purchase.ServiceAcceptance` (built, Warehouse P16b). The evidence file attaches to the order through existing OrderContent. InvoiceMatch reads the acceptance under the match policy's service-acceptance rule. For a subcontract line nobody enters it by hand: Manufacturing's `receive#SubcontractOutput` (built, Warehouse P16b) calls `accept#ServiceItem` with the output receipt and inspection evidence (D14; R-SA-13). Maintenance outside service is accepted the same way: Maintenance's CompleteWork calls `accept#ServiceItem` with the work order's evidence, and `link#MaintenancePurchase` writes `AssetMaintenanceOrderItem` rather than a required-work `OrderItemWorkEffort`, so `OrderItemWorkEffortCheckComplete` does not complete the part on its own (Nov 1, 2026; review R-MNT-06).

**Order context rules** (impl-purchasing §4; impl-drawers-commons §4). Supplier confirmation
is existing OrderPart.otherPartyOrderId/otherPartyOrderDate, with the acknowledged revision
and its outcome on OrderPart and a proposed promised date on each line, all audit-logged, so
each acknowledgement's history is the audit log; there is no acknowledgement record (F17, F18).
Header orderRevision exists; it is audit-logged with the key fields a phase locks (among them
OrderItem's unit, cancelled quantity, description and cost centre), so a revision is that
counter and its time, and the PO as of any revision or date is read back from the audit log.
There is no revision record. Approval invalidation is proposed.

**Commercial revision (Nov 1, 2026; review X2, R-SAL-02).** Mantle `increment#OrderRevision` is
narrowed to commercial changes behind a crosscut CX-AUTOMATION flag; for purchase orders it is the buying policy's
`PurchasePolicy.commercialRevisionOnly` (impl-purchasing P3), and a line's quantity or price change, which Mantle's counting
left out, counts under it (F-P3-2). OrderContent and OrderNote
changes and status-only part updates stop incrementing it. Storing the sent PDF, adding a file,
writing a note, placing, holding or approving therefore no longer move the revision a decision is
bound to. PurchaseApprovalDecision, the sent revision, the supplier's acknowledgement and the PASS
Supplier capability all bind to that one counter, which Sales quotes and Customer Service's
ChangeProposal share. Both flags are built (the sales direction's is the seller's
`PartyAcctgPreference.salesCommercialRevisionOnly`), so the fallback `get#OrderCommercialSnapshot`
hash is not needed (impl-sales F9).
Editing a released PO uses OrderChanges; hiding inputs is insufficient protection. Existing
OrderPart/OrderItem required/delivery dates are retained with the original requested date for
performance measurement. Recurring releases create a new draft release and recheck agreement
caps/approval; they never repeat a past receipt, bill or payment.

A stock item names a destination facility; a non-stock/service line names its acceptance owner
and two-way/acceptance policy, and records acceptance through RecordServiceAcceptance. Buying
changed material cannot silently alter a released BOM snapshot. Tax, posting and exchange
policies remain Accounting-owned; purchase estimates are labelled estimates. Landed-cost
allocation is Accounting's `Accounting/Payables/LandedCosts` task, posted through
proposed `AssetBookServices.post#LandedCost`; Purchasing links to it from InvoiceDetail and Spend
(§17 Decided, landed costs).

**Subcontracting** (D14; R-PUR-22). Manufacturing's subcontract requirements appear in
SupplyPlanning with method outside processing. Converting one creates the service OrderItem
with an existing `OrderItemWorkEffort` row to the operation work effort (`requiredWork` Y) and a
proposed RequirementSupply row; the service quantity and UOM come from the requirement, and the
expected acceptance evidence is the output receipt and its inspection. Purchasing owns the
service PO and `accept#ServiceItem`. Warehouse dispatches and returns components at
`Warehouse/Transfers/SubcontractShipmentDetail`, to a vendor-custody facility whose
`ownerPartyId` is the organization, with the supplier as a FacilityParty (proposed role
Custodian), so the stock stays the company's and ownership does not become a purchase (R-SA-08).
Outside processing completion and the return of components are separately evidenced.
Manufacturing's proposed `receive#SubcontractOutput` receives the processed output once, under
one receipt identity shared by Manufacturing and Warehouse, consumes the components and calls
`accept#ServiceItem` (R-SA-13). The output is never received on the service
PO line, and service lines never get a receipt-SECA bill; the supplier's service invoice comes
in through `import#Bill`, adds authorized production cost and creates no second finished-stock
receipt.

**Drop-ship** (impl-purchasing §4, F21; R-PUR-17, R-SB-20). Drop-ship is done as Moqui Java's
unmerged `dropship-moqui` branch of mantle-udm and mantle-usl does it, ported into mr-mantle.
The drop-ship facility is the proposed facility type `FcTpDropShip`, owned by the supplier
(`ownerPartyId`) with `assetAllowOtherOwner` Y, and the proposed `Facility.dropShipRemoteId`
names the SystemMessageRemote of the supplier's integration; the `CustomerShipFrom` and
`VendorShipTo` order roles come with it. A sales line drops to a supplier by its reservation at
that facility, against the supplier's stock or Mantle's shell asset with negative availability.
Proposed `mantle.order.OrderServices.create#DropShipPurchaseOrder`, run beside
`reserve#AssetsForOrder` in its SECA, clones the sales order into a PO for the lines reserved
there: the PO's `parentOrderId` is the sales order; each part has the facility's owner as vendor,
the selling organization as customer and the end customer as a `CustomerShipTo` OrderPartParty
with the sales part's ship-to; lines are priced from the supplier's price. It then calls the
remote's `send#DropShipPurchaseOrderPart`; a facility with no remote sends the PO by
`send#PurchaseOrder`. Where the approval gate's flag is on, the PO is placed and waits for the
approval gate rather than being approved at once as in the branch; a sales line the service passes
over is named in its result. On the supplier's confirmation, entered by the buyer through OrderDetail's Confirm delivery
on the PO, called by the supplier's integration or reported from the Supplier app for the buyer's review, proposed
`finalize#DropShipPurchaseOrder` ships the PO's shipment with the confirmed quantities and
tracking code, then packs and ships the sales order's shipment with that tracking code, so
Mantle's pack SECA invoices the customer. The supplier bill comes through Accounting's intake and
matches against the shipped drop-ship delivery. A drop-ship line never invents a receipt into the
buyer's warehouse. ShpTpDrop and the earlier `confirm#DropShipDelivery`, with its two
InvoiceFromSource calls, are not used. "Drop-ship from supplier" on a customer order line,
offered to `BOSS_PURCHASING_BUYER` where the supplier's price has `canDropShip`, moves the line to
that supplier's drop-ship facility and reserves there, so the same service makes the PO;
RequestSourcing and SupplyPlanning route customer demand the same way. As built (impl-purchasing P7): one PO per sales
part and drop-ship facility; each PO line keeps its sales line (`OrderItem.salesOrderId`, `salesOrderItemSeqId`), which the
delivery, the match and the screens read; the drop-ship facility also needs `assetAllowIssueOverQoh` Y, since the sales
shipment issues the shell asset; the PO is made once the sales order's approval commits, in a transaction of its own, so
that a failure never undoes the sales approval, and goes to the supplier once its own approval commits; a line with no
supplier price leaves its PO Open for the buyer, and a supplier the buying policy stops is passed over; the confirmation posts the
delivered lines' cost from Unreceived Inventory to the cost of goods sold (`AttDropShipDelivery`), the supplier's bill
debiting Unreceived Inventory as for any stock purchase; Supplier360's Drop-ship tab keeps the facility and its remote
(`store#DropShipFacility`, PURCHASE_POLICY_EDIT).

**Existing automation on the PO path** (D1; crosscut §1.3 register). Each condition below sits behind its own flag,
off by default, on its owner's settings, so plain Mantle keeps its behavior (impl-accounting §4).

| Mantle SECA | What it does on a PO | This design |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OrderPlacedAutoApprove` (`autoApprove#Order`) | Approves a placed order whose payments cover the total and whose `check#OrderPreApprove` returns no warning; with no ProductStore that includes a prepaid or zero-total PO | Conditioned, where the organization's buying policy turns the approval gate's flag on: proposed SECA `mantle.order.PurchaseServices.check#PurchaseApprovalRequired` on `mantle.order.OrderInfoServices.check#OrderPreApprove` adds an approve warning for any purchase part whose vendor is not OrgInternal and that lacks a current PurchaseApprovalDecision for the order revision (D8; R-SB-10; impl-purchasing §2). Nov 1, 2026 (X4): the manual `approve#Order` now checks direction, so a purchase part needs proposed `PURCHASE_ORDER_APPROVE`, and it runs `check#OrderPreApprove` too, refusing on the warning unless a current decision is recorded; the D8 hook therefore guards manual approval as well. As built (impl-purchasing P3): the direction check is the gate's, so with the flag off a purchase part takes `PURCHASE_ORDER_APPROVE` or `ORDER_APPROVE` as before, and approve#Order refuses on the purchase approval's warning only (`check#OrderPreApprove` warns every unpaid PO, F-P3-4) |
| `OrderPlacedSendEmail`, `OrderApprovedSendEmail` (`send#OrderStoreEmail`) | Nothing; a PO has no ProductStore | Kept; the proposed `send#PurchaseOrder` sends POs |
| `OrderPlacedReserveAssets`, `OrderApprovedReserveAssets`, `OrderItemCreateCheckReserve`, `OrderItemUpdateCheckReserve` | Nothing; reservation returns early when the vendor is not an internal organization | Kept; with the drop-ship port, a sales line reserved at a drop-ship facility runs `create#DropShipPurchaseOrder` beside `reserve#AssetsForOrder` (Drop-ship above) |
| `OrderPlacedAuthorizePayments` (`authorize#OrderPayments`) | Nothing; it returns without a ProductStore | Kept; a supplier prepayment is an Accounting payment request |
| `OrderApprovedNotify` | High-priority order notice | Kept |
| `OrderItemWorkEffortCheckComplete` | Completes the part when every `requiredWork` work effort is complete, closed or cancelled and the items are received | Kept; a subcontract service line completes with its operation, and matching still waits for `accept#ServiceItem` |
| `ShipmentIncomingDeliveredCreateInvoices` | Bills a delivered incoming shipment | Conditioned to self-billing suppliers, behind Accounting's receipt-billing flag (§10 Bills; D2) |
| `ReturnApprovedProcess` | Creates the ShpTpPurchaseReturn shipment; its response processing does nothing for a supplier return | Conditioned (crosscut §1.3; D11): approval only creates the return shipment, which on a supplier return is all it does (§9 ReturnDetail) |

### OrderChanges

**Layout.** wizard: propose changes, show effects, obtain current approval, publish revision.

**Forms.**

| Form | Kind | Purpose | Highlighted fields | Widgets of note | Services | Derived from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ProposedChange | wizard step | Capture requested PO change | order/revision, item, qty/UOM, price, required date, substitute, reason | old/new values | proposed `mantle.order.OrderServices.preview#PurchaseRevision` | Odoo locked confirmed PO; Carbon PO revisions |
| RevisionEffects | display | Show operational and financial dependencies | received/billed qty, open shipment, budget delta, agreement cap, demand allocation | source links; blocked change reasons | proposed `mantle.order.OrderServices.preview#PurchaseRevision` | Carbon purchase order revision history |
| ApplyRevision | wizard step | Commit approved revision and notification obligation | operation ID, source revision, decision ID, effective date, reason, notify recipients | explicit confirm; retry status | proposed `mantle.order.OrderServices.apply#PurchaseRevision`; `mantle.order.OrderServices.increment#OrderRevision` as guarded primitive | Carbon revision approval; Odoo unlock/lock |

**Actions and states.** Refuse decreasing below received/billed/returned net constraints, changing currency/supplier on a progressed part or editing posted evidence. Price/date/spec changes invalidate affected decisions and supplier acknowledgements. A revision plus allocation/budget changes commits atomically; email delivery is a separately reported retryable obligation tied to that revision. SupplierRejectedRevision leaves the previous confirmed contract visible and requires buyer resolution; no automatic replacement of already received material.

**Lock and apply** (D7; R-PUR-05, R-SB-07). Starting a revision on a placed, processing or approved PO calls proposed `hold#Order` with an OrderHoldReason of type Change, sourced to the order and its revision; a Sent PO first un-sends to OrderApproved. Mantle treats a held order as editable. `apply#PurchaseRevision` then, in one transaction: writes the changes to the audit-logged fields with the reason, calls `increment#OrderRevision`, calls Warehouse's proposed `mantle.shipment.WarehouseTaskServices.adjust#ExpectedReceipt` to set each open ShpTpPurchase source to the new remaining quantity (R-SB-13), calls Accounting's proposed `convert#Commitment` or `release#Commitment` for the budget delta (D10), and calls Accounting's proposed `MatchServices.queue#MatchReevaluation` for the affected bills (R-SB-19). `adjust#ExpectedReceipt` refuses to go below the received quantity and returns ReceiptInProgress when a receive operation holds the source; the revision then fails with that named result. After policy approval, `release#OrderHold` returns the order to OrderApproved and the buyer resends the new revision through `send#PurchaseOrder`, which stores the new revision's PDF.

**As built (impl-purchasing P9).** Start is `mantle.order.OrderServices.start#PurchaseRevision` (the Change hold, its source the
revision it starts from) and Let the change go `cancel#PurchaseRevision`; the proposed change is kept in the page until
applied. Receiving goes on while the order changes: ReceiptInProgress is a receipt or bill posted since the change was
reviewed (the preview's basis key), and the apply locks the open receipts first (F-P9-1). The apply counts the revision once
(F-P9-3), releases a lowered line's budget commitment to what it still needs through Accounting's internal
`lower#SourceCommitments` (a raised line is reserved by the approval, F-P9-4) and notifies the new revision's approvers. The
approval is `decide#PurchaseApproval` on the held order: its last step releases the revision's Change hold (to Approved, or
to Placed and then approved), a refusal leaves the order held for the buyer; `release#OrderHold` is not used for it, since
OhtChange's release permission is ORDER_APPROVE (F-P9-2). A substitute follows the buying policy's substitution rule
(`PurchasePolicy.substitutionEnumId`, not allowed by default). Not built: a ship-to choice and adding a line (F-P9-9).

**New revision envelope fields.** `operationId`, `orderId`, `orderRevision`, `proposedRevision`, `changeRows` (part/item, field, oldValue, newValue, quantityUomId/currencyUomId), `reason`, `effectiveDate`, `approvalDecisionId`, `sourceAllocationChanges`, `notificationRecipients`, `resultStatus`, `errorCode`, `retryable`. Posted records are never rewritten by this envelope. The envelope is not stored: there is no revision record, and the change rows are read back from the audit log (impl-purchasing §4).

### Acknowledgements

**Layout.** list with unacknowledged, changed promise and overdue filters.

**Forms.**

| Form | Kind | Purpose | Highlighted fields | Widgets of note | Services | Derived from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AcknowledgementList | list | Track confirmations by current PO revision | PO/revision, supplier, sent, promised date, response, late reason | drill to item history | proposed `ironstone.purchasing.OrderServices.find#Acknowledgements` | ERPNext order_confirmation_no/date; Odoo receipt reminder |
| RecordAcknowledgement | dialog | Enter supplier response received by phone/email | PO revision, supplier ref/date, lines qty/date, accepted/rejected, evidence | original request versus promise | proposed `mantle.order.OrderServices.record#Acknowledgement` | ERPNext PO confirmation fields; Carbon PO acknowledgment |
| SendReminder | list, bulk | Request confirmations from selected suppliers | PO/revision, contact, message, expected reply date | preview per supplier | proposed `mantle.order.OrderServices.send#PurchaseReminder` | Odoo receipt_reminder_email controls |

**As built (impl-purchasing P9).** `record#Acknowledgement` writes OrderPart's `acknowledgedRevision`, `acknowledgementEnumId`
(Accepted, Accepted with changes, Rejected; a changed or rejected one needs the supplier's reason), `acknowledgedDate` and
`acknowledgementNote` with the reference and date, and each line's `promisedDate` and `promisedQuantity`; RecordAcknowledgement
takes one promised date for every line and OrderDetail's Promise a line's own (F-P9-8). The list's views are
Unacknowledged, Changed promise, Overdue (the buying policy's reminder days since the revision was first emailed, F-P9-10) and
All sent. Reminders (`MANTLE_PURCHASE_REMINDER`) dedupe on revision, template and occurrence (by default the day).

**Actions and states.** An acknowledgement is OrderPart's supplier reference and date, the acknowledged revision and its outcome on OrderPart, and each line's promised date, all audit-logged; its evidence is OrderContent in the supplier's role, and there is no acknowledgement record (impl-purchasing §4). Buyers enter acknowledgements on the supplier's behalf before the supplier pages exist and after (§13). Supplier promises never change ordered quantities without OrderChanges. Buyer accepts a date change with an audit reason; original due date remains for OTD reporting. Reminders have per-recipient delivery outcomes and deduplicate on PO revision/template/reminder occurrence. Independent delivery failures do not mark all reminders sent.

**Needs.** PUR-ORDER, PUR-PORTAL, PUR-SHELL.

### Approvals

**Context passed.** Mount `Purchasing/Approvals`, a top-level menu item; [Commons §4](design-drawers-commons.md#4-header-and-drawer-screens) and crosscut §3.15. This is Purchasing's row of the crosscut §3.15 table (R-XC-12): request, award, PO and supplier approvals / purchase topics and buying organization / decide against the current revision / budget commitment. Filter to the topics PurchaseRequestApproval, PurchaseAwardApproval, PurchaseOrderApproval and PurchaseSupplierApproval and the current recipient: the mount passes Purchasing's topic list to `get#UserNotifications`, which takes a list of topics, not an `appName` filter (impl-accounting §4). Agreement activation comes on PurchaseOrderApproval, with the agreement as source. The list rows are pending proposed PurchaseApprovalDecision steps; the notification is the delivery, not the record. Show source, amount/currency, policy tier, revision, budget result and due date. Approve and refuse call the proposed topic handlers `approve#PurchaseSource` and `refuse#PurchaseSource` (§1), never a NotificationMessage mutation; body and actions use the same source access check as the PO/request. Refusal moves a PO OrderPlaced → OrderRejected, leaves a request ReqSubmitted with the refused decision, leaves an award's quotes unplaced and sets a supplier's approval status Rejected. Stale or superseded requests link to the current revision without accepting a decision.

As built (impl-purchasing P4): the topics are seeded in mr-mantle with `mantle.order.PurchaseServices.approve#PurchaseSource`
and `refuse#PurchaseSource`, and a supplier's is PurchaseSupplierApproval. A row's title carries the source, revision,
supplier, amount and step; the budget result shows on OrderDetail's approvals to an approver, not in the list, since the
notice is sent by the buyer, who may not read budgets (F-P4-8).

**Needs.** PUR-APPROVAL, PUR-SHELL.

**Actions and states.** Use active mantle.party.agreement.Agreement/AgreementItem/AgreementTerm and ProductPrice.agreementId/agreementItemSeqId. AgrPurchase is proposed seed data; existing AgrProduct/AgrSales do not imply a purchase workflow. Purchase lines use the existing AgreementItemType `AitPurchase` (R-PUR-30). `Agreement.statusId` has the StatusType Agreement but no seeded status, so PUR-AGREEMENT proposes the flow AgmStDraft → AgmStActive → AgmStExpired or AgmStClosed, plus AgmStCancelled; the prefix avoids the Agr IDs already in use. This seed is the one Mantle Agreement status flow: Sales' customer AgreementDetail adopts the same five states and transitions, and the two AgreementDetail screens may share the header, terms and items forms (Nov 1, 2026; review X13). AgreementItem has quantity and quantityUomId but no amount, so the value cap is the proposed `AgreementItem.amountCap`. A release over the remaining quantity or value is refused unless it is within the proposed `AgreementItem.releaseTolerancePercent`. Proposed release allocations, a record of their own, preserve order/item/quantity/value and the agreement's revision time; transaction locks prevent two releases exceeding quantity/value cap. Cancel releases only their unused commitment. Versions are the audit log (impl-purchasing §4): Mantle already logs Agreement's status, other party and dates and AgreementItem's quantity, and the caps, tolerance and terms are added; AgreementItems and terms are effective-dated. A key-field change counts the agreement's `agreementRevision` once; a material term edit needs a new approval, and a changed active agreement takes no release until its new revision is approved (impl-purchasing P13), the agreement prints as of a date, and signers and other parties are AgreementParty rows. Rebates and retrospective settlements are later financial extensions; no mutable historical PO repricing.

**Context passed.** Mount `Purchasing/Agreements/LeaseOverview`; [Accounting Leases](design-accounting.md#leases). Later read/authorized setup mount of Accounting-owned lease definition and schedule. Fix supplier, asset and buying organization; show contract, installments, approval and journal links.

## 8. Replenishment

### SupplyPlanning

**Context passed.** Mount `Purchasing/Replenishment/SupplyPlanning`; [crosscut §3.20](design-crosscut.md#320-supplyplanning). Fix authorized buying organizations/facilities; default buy suggestions but show the entire buy/make/transfer demand provenance and existing supply. The shared proposed mantle.request.requirement.PlanningRun, PlanningSuggestion and RequirementSupply with proposed `mantle.product.SupplyPlanningServices.run#SupplyPlan`, `get#SupplyPlan` and `convert#PlanningSuggestions` own calculation and conversion. Manufacturing builds them (CX-PLANNING) with the make conversion and the outside-processing service PO lines, those for `BOSS_PURCHASING_BUYER` on the Manufacturing mount; Purchasing adds this mount and the buy conversion (impl-manufacturing §4). There is one current PlanningRun per organization and facility set. Any planner starts it from the Purchasing, Manufacturing or Warehouse mount, or the schedule set through proposed `store#PlanSchedule` starts it (D20; R-XC-39). A new run supersedes unconverted suggestions.

Purchasing converts buy suggestions; Manufacturing converts make suggestions and Warehouse transfer suggestions (D20). Buyers change supplier/date/lot size and convert eligible buy suggestions to draft PO or approved purchase requests according to policy, as crosscut §4.2 now allows (§17, Shared-screen rows), or customer demand to the drop-ship route (§6 Drop-ship). A planner who also holds stock-planning authority may convert transfer suggestions here; they cannot masquerade as purchases (R-XC-20). Make conversion creates a draft production order in WeInPlanning; explicit Manufacturing release freezes its BOM/routing snapshot. Conversion checks product usability through Products' `check#ProductUsable` (D19).

Approved purchase-request demand is already covered: its Requirement carries RequirementSupply rows from RequestSourcing or Award, and the conversion lock is on the Requirement's remaining quantity (R-PUR-06). Customer-order demand (RqTpCustomer) converted to a PO keeps the sales OrderItem in its RequirementSupply provenance, and the receipt offers to reserve the received stock for that order item through existing `mantle.product.AssetServices.reserve#AssetForOrderItem` (R-PUR-37). Manufacturing's subcontract requirements show with method outside processing; converting one writes the service OrderItem with `OrderItemWorkEffort` and RequirementSupply (§6 Order context rules; R-PUR-22). Component demand and output supply of production runs come from the WorkEffortProduct rows that Manufacturing maintains (crosscut §4.2; R-SA-05).

Freeze horizon, lead time, pack/MOQ rounding, safety stock, substitutes and demand source are visible. Existing `mantle.product.InventoryReportServices.get#InventoryProjectedInfo` uses search projections; missing/stale/truncated projection is a named planning limitation, not zero demand. Receipts held for inspection (AstQuarantine) show as a pending-release line with the inspection's due date and status from `QualityServices.get#SourceInspectionStatus`; they are left out of netting by default, and the plan schedule's organization option nets held quantity whose inspection is due within the lead time (D21; impl-manufacturing §4; impl-purchasing §4). Fresh transactional quantity/status/version checks guard conversion. DemandAlreadyCovered after a competing conversion leaves a named row failure and no duplicate PO (built, impl-purchasing P14a: DEMAND_ALREADY_COVERED naming the covering line; a retry of the same operation answers its first result). Scheduled reorder invokes this same plan and conversion policy.

Built in impl-purchasing P14b (`SupplyPlanningRoutes.js`, `PurchasePegs.js`): with the buying policy's `planBuyToRequest` a buy conversion makes one purchase request per organization and facility in the call, sent to its approval, a line per customer order line of the requirement (with a RequestItemOrder to it, so RequestSourcing's drop-ship route can take it) and one for the rest, each a RequirementSupply RstPurchaseRequest on the plan's requirement (an order route asked for then is ROUTE_NOT_ALLOWED); Convert's route "Drop-ship customer orders" moves each approved customer order line of the shortage to the supplier's drop-ship facility through `route#OrderItemToDropShip`, the drop-ship purchase order line covering the requirement, the rest left to convert. The plan counts the lines of the organization's approved purchase requests (and of a submitted one a conversion made) not yet ordered as supply, so approved request demand is not suggested again. A sales line reserved without stock (whose shortage nets as negative availability) is shown and pegged in the provenance, so customer-order demand keeps its sales line (RequirementOrderItem). A bought product's held quantity nets within its supplier price's standard lead time where the schedule says so. The receipt of a purchase line bought for customer-order demand offers to reserve its stock (available, or on hold at the dock for its putaway) for that sales line (§9 ShipmentDetail).

**Needs.** CX-PLANNING, PUR-REORDER.

### InventoryAvailability

**Context passed.** Mount `Purchasing/Replenishment/InventoryAvailability`; [crosscut §3.7](design-crosscut.md#37-inventoryavailability). Fix product/facility from the request, PO or planning suggestion; show physical, reserved, usable/free, held/rejected and time-phased incoming/outgoing quantities with UOM and snapshot time. Purchasing can inspect sources and propose supply; stock adjustments, reservation override and quality release require their separate action grants. `mantle.product.AssetServices.get#AvailableInventory` and `get#AvailableInventoryMulti` are existing quantities primitives; the richer freshness/hold projection is proposed. A promise excludes inspection-held receipts until authorized disposition. A planner who edits a minimum or reorder quantity from here writes through the same `mantle.facility.FacilityServices.store#ProductFacilityPolicy` (built, Products P7) as ReorderRules (D20).

**Needs.** CX-AVAILABILITY, CX-FACILITY-POLICY.

### ReorderRules

**Layout.** settings list; editable ProductFacility rows and schedule policy form.

**Forms.**

| Form | Kind | Purpose | Highlighted fields | Widgets of note | Services | Derived from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| ReorderRuleList | list, editable rows | Maintain minimum, maximum and order quantities | product, facility, minimumStock, maximumStock and reorderMethodEnumId (fixed quantity or up to maximum; built, Products P7), reorderQuantity, daysToShip, proposed snooze/thru with reason | base-UOM labels and plan link | `mantle.facility.FacilityServices.store#ProductFacilityPolicy` (built, Products P7) | Facility/EditFacilityProducts AddProductForm/ProductList; Odoo reordering rules |
| SuggestLevels | list, bulk | Preview and apply suggested minimum and maximum levels | product, facility, average daily demand, lead time, safety stock, suggested minimum and maximum, row result | preview before apply; named per-row failures | proposed `store#ProductFacilityPolicy` | Facility/EditFacilityProducts ProductList; Odoo reordering rules |
| PlanSchedule | single | Set common planning cadence and approval behavior | facilities, horizon, schedule, buyer, auto-request/preview, safety policy | preview run before enable | proposed `mantle.product.SupplyPlanningServices.store#PlanSchedule`; proposed `run#SupplyPlan` for the preview | ERPNext auto-reorder settings; Odoo automate/snooze |

**Actions and states.** Run planning and inspect suggestions before enabling a schedule. Snooze is dated and reasoned; it suppresses automatic conversion, not shortage visibility. Auto-create defaults to proposed requirements/requests; auto-approve requires explicit policy and source authorization. Duplicate jobs reuse run/conversion identities. Import/update batches name each product/facility failure independently and retain valid changes.

Every ProductFacility write, from here, Products, Warehouse or InventoryAvailability, goes through the Warehouse-owned contract `store#ProductFacilityPolicy` (CX-FACILITY-POLICY; built, Products P7), so the same validation applies everywhere (D20; R-XC-09). The plan schedule is a SupplyPlanning setting shared with the Manufacturing and Warehouse mounts, not a Purchasing schedule. The earlier proposed `PlanningServices.store#ReorderRule` and `store#ReorderSchedule` are dropped. `ProductFacility.maximumStock` (order-up-to level) and `reorderMethodEnumId` (a fixed quantity, or up to the maximum), built in Products P7, go through the same `store#ProductFacilityPolicy`, audit-logged, as the snooze will be, and `run#SupplyPlan` reads them. SuggestLevels previews the minimum and maximum from average daily demand × lead time + safety stock and applies them per row with named failures; a product without demand history is named (R-PUR-19; impl-purchasing §4). Built (impl-purchasing P14a): the plan treats the minimum as the reorder point, and a shortage below it orders up to the maximum (RdmUpToMaximum: the net plus maximum − minimum) or at least the reorder quantity (RdmFixedQuantity); SuggestLevels' demand is what was issued from the facility and those under it over the history days, its lead time the supplier price's `standardLeadTimeDays` else one the planner gives (a product with neither is named NO_LEAD_TIME), its safety stock the safety days of demand and its maximum the minimum plus the cover days of demand, in whole units (`mantle.facility.ReorderRuleServices`). The snooze is `ProductFacility.snoozeThruDate` and `snoozeReason`, audit-logged; the plan marks a snoozed rule's suggestion SNOOZED and `convert#PlanningSuggestions` with `automatic` leaves it (SUGGESTION_SNOOZED); a person may still convert it.

## 9. Receiving and returns

### Receipts

**Layout.** list of expected, partial, late, held and completed supplier receipts.

**Forms.**

| Form | Kind | Purpose | Highlighted fields | Widgets of note | Services | Derived from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ReceiptFind | find | Filter inbound supplier work | supplier, PO, facility, ETA, shipment/inspection state | date-period | none | Shipment/FindShipment ShipmentList |
| ExpectedReceipts | list | Show expected and physical quantities separately | PO/item, shipment, supplier, expected, received, accepted, rejected, held | source links and UOM labels | proposed `ironstone.purchasing.ReceiptServices.find#ExpectedReceipts` | Shipment/FindShipment ShipmentList; Carbon PO receiving |
| PrepareReceipt | dialog | Expected receipt (ASN): record or update the one open inbound receipt for a PO part | PO/part, selected items/qty, facility, expected date, supplier shipment reference | source selection | `mantle.shipment.WarehouseTaskServices.ensure#PurchaseReceipt` (built, Warehouse P7) | Order/OrderDetail AddOrderPartToShipmentForm |

**Actions and states.** Open the shared ShipmentDetail for physical receipt; buyers without receiving capability see progress and request corrections. PrepareReceipt is labelled "Expected receipt (ASN)". It calls Warehouse's proposed `ensure#PurchaseReceipt`, which returns the open ShpTpPurchase shipment for the part in Input or Scheduled, or creates one, so a PO part has one open inbound receipt whichever app starts it (R-SB-12). Mantle allows that shipment only for an approved or sent part. Overreceipt requires configured allowance and specific authority. A short receipt is finished by Warehouse's proposed `close#ReceiptRemainder`: for close it calls `close#PurchaseRemainders` (§6), and for backorder it calls `ensure#PurchaseReceipt` for the remainder; only then does it deliver the shipment (R-SB-11; R-PUR-10). An unavailable projection never enables a receipt action using a stale remaining quantity. As built (impl-purchasing P5): the supplier shipment reference waits for a parameter of `ensure#PurchaseReceipt` (F-P5-3).

**Needs.** PUR-RECEIPT, PUR-ACCESS.

### ShipmentDetail

**Context passed.** Mount `Purchasing/Receiving/ShipmentDetail`; [crosscut §3.8](design-crosscut.md#38-shipmentdetail). Inbound purchase and supplier-return outbound context; tabs: source PO, expected/received items, lots/serials, inspection/putaway, packages, receipt documents, bill links and Chatter. Receiver actions use existing `mantle.shipment.ShipmentServices.receive#ShipmentProduct` through Warehouse's posting guard (WH-POST), or create outbound return shipment from ReturnDetail. When an inspection applies, the guard receives into AstQuarantine (D21). `receive#EntireShipment` accepts every unit not yet handled and then delivers the shipment, so it is offered only as "Receive all as expected" with explicit confirmation; a short receipt uses Warehouse's ReceiveRemaining and `close#ReceiptRemainder` (R-SB-11). Shipment status alone does not certify quality acceptance; expose accepted/rejected/held quantities and AssetReceipt references. Each receipt records the proposed entered quantity, entered UOM and applied conversion factor, so a PO line in `OrderItem.quantityUomId` converts at receipt without losing what was counted (crosscut §4.1; R-SA-06). Handheld uses scan product/PO/location/lot/serial, count UOM, confirm and named result with operation identity; a scanned pack barcode resolves to the base product and quantity through Products' proposed `ProductServices.resolve#ScannedProduct` (crosscut §4.1). Browser/terminal invoke the same transaction. When the PO line is pegged to a sales order item, the receipt offers to reserve the stock for it (R-PUR-37). A user with AP intake capability can open the shared InvoiceFromSource dialog here on the accepted-received basis (D2). A supplier return can be packed/shipped here only with warehouse authority; Warehouse's proposed `ship#SupplierReturn` moves it to ReturnShipped. The crosscut §3.8 Purchasing row has that outbound packing (§17, Shared-screen rows).

Built in impl-purchasing P14b (R-PUR-37): a received line bought for customer-order demand (the plan's conversion of a requirement with customer order lines, or a request line with a RequestItemOrder to one) shows "Bought for customer orders" with each sales line's waiting and reserved quantities, and a holder of the receive permission reserves the received stock for it (`mantle.order.PurchasePegServices.reserve#ReceiptPeg`, over `reserve#AssetForOrderItem` with the asset first).

### QualityInspection

**Context passed.** Mount `Purchasing/Receiving/QualityInspection`; [crosscut §3.19](design-crosscut.md#319-qualityinspection-and-inspectiontemplates). Pass AssetReceipt/source shipment, supplier, product, lot/serial, PO item and template revision. Display Draft/Submitted/Verified/Disposed stage separately from accepted/rejected/partial result. Inspector records and verifies; authorized disposition releases accepted stock, returns, scraps or keeps a hold atomically. Verification itself does not release stock. Buyers can raise supplier corrective follow-up via existing Request/WorkItem links; advanced NCR/CAPA is later. Receipts that need inspection arrive in AstQuarantine through Warehouse's posting guard (D21). `mantle.product.QualityServices.get#SourceInspectionStatus` gives InvoiceMatch and SupplyPlanning the open-inspection quantity, which is excluded from bill matching and from usable supply until disposition. Failed inspection reduces match-eligible quantity and supply availability until disposition. Disposition queues a match re-evaluation for the receipt's bills (R-SB-19). The crosscut §3.19 Purchasing row lets holders of the inspect, verify and dispose capabilities act here; others read (§17, Shared-screen rows).

**Needs.** CX-QUALITY.

### InspectionTemplates

**Context passed.** Mount `Purchasing/Receiving/InspectionTemplates`; [crosscut §3.19](design-crosscut.md#319-qualityinspection-and-inspectiontemplates). Filter templates for purchase receipts; versioned supplier/product/category applicability, sampling, limits, required readings and verifier roles. Only quality administrators edit drafts; published versions and any version already referenced by an inspection or released production snapshot are immutable. No second purchasing template entity. The screen is a settings screen with a list and an inline editor; its menu entry is under Settings, as a row of Settings' landing (impl-purchasing P5).

**Needs.** CX-QUALITY.

### Returns

**Layout.** list of supplier return cases with create-from-source dialog.

**Forms.**

| Form | Kind | Purpose | Highlighted fields | Widgets of note | Services | Derived from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ReturnFind | find | Find supplier returns | supplier, PO, receipt, return state, physical state, credit/replacement state | separate status filters | none | Return/FindReturn ReturnHeaderList |
| SupplierReturnList | list | Track return authorization and outcomes | return, supplier RMA, qty, dispatched, credited, replacement due | shared ReturnDetail link | proposed `ironstone.purchasing.ReturnServices.find#SupplierReturns` | Return/FindReturn ReturnHeaderList; Carbon Purchase Return Orders |
| NewSupplierReturn | dialog | Select eligible source quantities | supplier, PO/receipt, lot, selected lines/qty, reason, response, RMA | source eligibility preview by receipt and lot | `mantle.order.ReturnServices.find#ReturnableReceipts` (built by Warehouse P14, with `add#ReceiptToReturn`); `mantle.order.ReturnServices.create#ReturnFromOrder` | Return/FindReturn CreateSupplierReturn; Return/AddOrderItems |

**Actions and states.** Choose supplier return rather than customer return from source direction. Eligibility comes from proposed `find#ReturnableReceipts`, which Warehouse builds with its receipt link as Purchasing's contract (impl-warehouse §4): AssetReceipt accepted plus quarantined quantity, minus earlier supplier returns, locked per receipt and lot (D11; R-SB-06). Mantle's `calculate#OrderItemReturnable` is not used for supplier returns, because it counts billed quantity and a rejected lot is usually returned before the supplier bills. A return of unbilled quantity lowers the match-eligible receipt and needs no credit; Accounting's proposed `settle#Return` credits only the billed portion. Proposed receipt linkage makes a particular lot/receipt explicit. RMA expiry, attachment and supplier-approved instructions are recorded (the RMA number on the return; expiry and instructions as a file of type Authorization until the return has fields for them, impl-purchasing F-P8-3). Failed quality can create a supplier return without making rejected stock available to general picking.

**Needs.** PUR-RETURN, PUR-RECEIPT.

### ReturnDetail

**Context passed.** Mount `Purchasing/Returns/ReturnDetail`; [crosscut §3.18](design-crosscut.md#318-returndetail). Pass supplier return, buying organization, receipt/lot provenance and response (credit, refund or replacement). Tabs: Authorization/RMA, source quantities, outbound shipment, replacement, credit/refund, evidence. Existing `mantle.order.ReturnServices.create#Return`, `request#Return`, `approve#Return`, `add#OrderItemToReturn`, `update#ReturnItem`, `create#ReturnShipment`, `get#ReturnDisplayInfo`, `cancel#Return` remain guarded primitives. Proposed ReturnItem→AssetReceipt allocation identifies the exact returned receipt. Outbound uses ShpTpPurchaseReturn. Buyer authorizes permitted business return (`mantle.order.ReturnServices.authorize#SupplierReturn`, RETURN_AUTHORIZE, with the supplier's RMA; impl-purchasing P8) and requests settlement; warehouse dispatches; Accounting settles. Physical dispatch, replacement due and financial credit/refund remain separate. Cancellation before dispatch releases allocated quantity; after dispatch use an explicit reversal/return-of-return and retain history. Closed-period correction posts in an authorized open period.

**Owners on the supplier return** (D11). Approval runs Mantle's `ReturnApprovedProcess`, which is kept: it creates the ShpTpPurchaseReturn shipment, and its `process#ReturnItemResponses` does nothing for a supplier return. Packing that shipment creates no invoice, because its sources carry a returnId and no orderId. Warehouse's `WarehouseTaskServices.ship#SupplierReturn` (built, Warehouse P14) moves the return items to ReturnShipped when the shipment ships (R-SB-05). Accounting's `mantle.order.ReturnServices.preview#ReturnSettlement` and `settle#Return` (built, Accounting P17) settle it on the supplier branch: per the response they create an incoming supplier credit memo (InvoiceCreditMemo, supplier to organization) or a debit note, link ReturnItemBilling to the original bill item, refuse an amount over the billed eligible value and set ReturnCompleted. A supplier's restocking fee or other charge is an explicit preview line on that credit (R-PUR-23). A replacement is proposed `mantle.order.ReturnServices.create#ReplacementOrder`: a linked PO plus `ensure#PurchaseReceipt` for its expected receipt. Settlement queues a match re-evaluation for the original bill (R-SB-19). `receive#ReturnWithoutShipment` is not exposed. Files on the return use the proposed ReturnContent (D25).

**Needs.** PUR-RETURN, AC-02.

## 10. Bills and matching

### Bills

**Layout.** list focused on purchase bill sources and operational exceptions.

**Forms.**

| Form | Kind | Purpose | Highlighted fields | Widgets of note | Services | Derived from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BillFind | find | Filter authorized supplier invoices | supplier, PO, receipt, bill reference, status, match/hold, due | separate financial and match filters | none | Accounting/Invoice/FindInvoice InvoiceList |
| BillList | list | Show source and payable progress | bill, supplier, currency/total, accepted receipts, variance, hold, payment summary | shared InvoiceDetail/InvoiceMatch links | proposed `ironstone.accounting.MatchServices.find#BillExceptions` plus authorized Invoice find | Accounting/Invoice/FindInvoice InvoiceList |
| UploadSupplierBill | dialog | Capture file evidence for AP review | supplier, supplier reference, date, currency, amount, file, PO | upload and duplicate preview on organization, supplier and supplier reference | `mantle.account.InvoiceServices.import#Bill` (built, Accounting P6) | Accounting Bills BillUpload; Odoo vendor bill capture |

**Actions and states.** Upload creates an incoming/draft bill for review, never an approved payable. Manual buyer upload uses the same Accounting intake service as AP: `import#Bill` takes a buyer's upload for a bill on a PO of an organization the buyer belongs to (impl-accounting §4); later OCR/extraction adds suggested mappings to that intake, with confidence and review, not a second engine. Accounting owns bill intake (D2; R-XC-01). Proposed `import#Bill` keys a bill by organization, supplier and supplier reference, and refuses a second bill on the same key.

**Receipt bill SECA** (D1, D2; R-SB-01). Mantle's `ShipmentIncomingDeliveredCreateInvoices` runs `mantle.account.InvoiceServices.create#PurchaseShipmentInvoices` when an incoming shipment reaches ShipDelivered. As built it bills rejected and quarantined units at the PO price. BOSS conditions it behind Accounting's receipt-billing flag (impl-accounting §4): by default a receipt creates no supplier bill. The SECA runs only for a supplier whose proposed `SupplierProfile.selfBillingIndicator` is set (evaluated-receipt settlement). For that supplier it calls `create#PurchaseShipmentInvoices` with the proposed `acceptedOnly=true`, which bills accepted, released quantity only, skips the leftover line without an asset, excludes quantity under open inspection and keys the draft by shipmentId. For a self-billed receipt, a supplier upload attaches its evidence to the existing draft instead of creating a bill, and InvoiceMatch evaluates the draft two-way (PO and accepted receipt). Service lines, including subcontract lines, never get a receipt bill; their bills come in through `import#Bill` (D14). The self-billing default and the bill basis sit in Accounting's MatchPolicies (§12).

**Needs.** PUR-MATCH, PUR-ACCESS, PUR-LATER.

### InvoiceDetail

**Context passed.** Mount `Purchasing/Bills/InvoiceDetail`; [crosscut §3.16](design-crosscut.md#316-invoicedetail). Fix buying organization and supplier bill; tabs: header/items, PO/receipt sources, match/tolerances/holds, permitted payments, attachments/audit. Buyer investigates source errors; a match operator (buyer here, AP in Accounting) applies eligible allocations; only finance places and releases holds, approves the payable, posts correction or pays through shared Accounting actions (D4). An open hold blocks every payment path, not only payment runs: Accounting's settlement and payable payment guards refuse a held bill, and a payment for it stays unapplied with a named exception (R-SB-16). A supplier prepayment requested from OrderDetail applies here through the same guard. "Allocate to receipts" links a freight, duty or broker bill to Accounting's `Accounting/Payables/LandedCosts` task (§17 Decided, landed costs). No Accounting app-root grant is needed for that independently granted capability. `mantle.account.InvoiceServices.get#InvoiceDisplayInfo`, `apply#InvoiceToOrder`, `apply#InvoiceItemToOrder` and `apply#InvoiceToShipment` are existing display/link primitives under the new guard; they do not by themselves enforce a complete three-way match. Inaccessible payment instruments/tax/GL data remain masked. Source: Accounting/Invoice/EditInvoice, EditInvoiceItemOrders, EditInvoiceItemShipments.

### MatchExceptions

**Actions and states.** Open InvoiceMatch to allocate. Buyer may fix an incorrect source PO through OrderChanges or ask Warehouse to correct receipt evidence; cannot fabricate a receipt to clear an exception. Re-evaluation reports SourceChanged, MissingReceipt, InspectionHold, QuantityVariance, PriceVariance, TaxVariance, DuplicateBill and ClosedPeriod against the affected invoice/item. Independent invoices continue; each financial application is atomic. A tolerance pass is not an approval or automatic hold release. Re-evaluation also runs on its own: Accounting's proposed `MatchServices.queue#MatchReevaluation` is called after a bill is taken in, a receipt is corrected, an inspection is disposed, a PO revision is applied or a supplier return is settled, and a background job evaluates the queue with named per-bill results (R-SB-19). The manual ReevaluateMatch stays for a buyer who knows a source changed. RequestHoldRelease creates an Accounting Approvals item on the proposed `BillHoldRelease` topic; a finance user releases the hold through `release#InvoiceHold` (R-PUR-20). Only finance places a hold, through `hold#Invoice`. LegacyMatches is Accounting's legacy match backfill, offered here and in Accounting to AP and to a buyer with the match group: it links legacy bill lines to orders and receipts only from unambiguous OrderItemBilling and AssetReceipt evidence, names each ambiguous line as a match exception and goes on, and never matches an unexplained balance (impl-purchasing §4; impl-accounting §4).

**Needs.** PUR-MATCH.

### InvoiceMatch

**Context passed.** Mount `Purchasing/Bills/InvoiceMatch`; [crosscut §3.22](design-crosscut.md#322-invoicematch). Fix supplier, organization, bill revision and candidate PO/AssetReceipt lines. The built mantle.account.invoice.InvoiceMatch/InvoiceMatchLine/InvoiceHold, `mantle.account.InvoiceMatchServices` evaluate#InvoiceMatch and apply#InvoiceMatch, `mantle.account.InvoiceServices` hold#Invoice, release#InvoiceHold and request#HoldRelease (Accounting P6, P7), and BOSS's `ironstone.accounting.MatchServices.find#BillExceptions` define the shared service contract. Compare ordered, physically received, quality-accepted/released, previously billed and remaining eligible quantities in recorded units; net returns and prior credits affect remaining eligibility. Rejected/quarantined quantity is excluded: the open-inspection quantity comes from `QualityServices.get#SourceInspectionStatus` (built, Warehouse P8) (D21). Service/non-stock lines require an explicit two-way or service-acceptance policy, not fake stock receipts; accepted service quantity comes from ServiceAcceptance rows (built, Warehouse P16b; R-PUR-09). A self-billed draft is matched two-way against the PO and the accepted receipt (D2). Apply locks candidate remaining amounts/quantities, validates organization, currency, supplier, UOM, tax/tolerance policy row and commits allocation plus hold evidence atomically. Financial release/approval is a separate capability and revision-bound decision.

A match operator applies matches, through `mantle.account.InvoiceMatchServices.apply#InvoiceMatch` (built, Accounting P7) (D4; R-XC-02). Apply creates or updates Mantle's `OrderItemBilling` (order item, invoice item, AssetReceipt, shipment, quantity, amount) in the same transaction, because Mantle reads it for "already billed", for returnable quantity and in `apply#InvoiceItemToOrder` (R-SB-18). InvoiceMatchLine keeps the snapshot, tolerance and the match policy row it applied (effective-dated rows; impl-accounting §4); unapply reverses both. Tolerances, bill basis, receipt-required and same-rate rules come from Accounting's `Accounting/Settings/MatchPolicies` (§12). A buyer asks for a hold release through RequestHoldRelease (MatchExceptions); only finance places or releases a hold.

**Needs.** PUR-MATCH.

## 11. Performance

**Insights registration (impl-insights P4, Nov 7, 2026; F29).** Scorecards, Spend, Commitments, ProcurementTracker,
PurchaseHistory and SupplierStatement are `ironstone.insights.ReportCatalogEntry` rows (`Purchasing.*`) read by their routes'
screen authorization; no Purchasing metric is registered yet.

**Insights attention (impl-insights P5, Nov 7, 2026; F29).** Home's Draft orders, Approved not sent, Unacknowledged orders, Late
receipts, Held bills and Quotes expiring (`BuyerServices.get#Home` counters) are `ironstone.insights.AttentionProvider` rows
(`Purchasing.*`) opening the cards' views; Approvals waiting counts unread notifications, not the Approvals list, and is not
registered until one query serves both.

Register these measures and canonical report routes with [Insights](design-insights.md#6-report-catalog-and-domain-metrics),
including source basis, denominators, organization/supplier scope, currency/UOM and freshness.
The framework reporting engine now supplies panels, pivot transformations and exploration; each
Purchasing dataset/service adapter still needs the business guards and reconciled measure defined
here. Generic pivot/graph modes on every find screen remain later work. Insights delivery uses each
recipient's authority and cannot expose finance data withheld by these source reports.

### Scorecards

**Layout.** list of suppliers by effective evaluation period and evidence completeness.

**Forms.**

| Form | Kind | Purpose | Highlighted fields | Widgets of note | Services | Derived from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ScorecardFind | find | Filter supplier performance | supplier/class, period, buyer, score band, risk, data completeness | date-period | none | ERPNext Supplier Scorecard |

| EvaluateSuppliers | list, bulk | Produce a period evaluation | supplier list, period, policy row, operation ID | preview and named per-supplier result | proposed `mantle.party.SupplierServices.evaluate#SupplierScorecard` | ERPNext Supplier Scorecard period generation |

**Actions and states.** Low volume or unavailable evidence is Insufficient data, never a zero score silently converted to a block. An evaluation is a record of its own, keeping the policy row it applied; recalculation creates a new evaluation and the earlier one stays, and previous approved decisions retain their evaluated basis (impl-purchasing §2). Risk actions link a follow-up and policy decision; no score alone cancels orders.

As built (impl-purchasing P15): an evaluation is `mantle.party.supplier.SupplierScorecard` with a `SupplierScorecardMeasure` per measure and its `SupplierScorecardEvidence` rows; EvaluateSuppliers evaluates the suppliers chosen, or every supplier with a receipt in the period, each in its own transaction with a named result. An evaluation keeps the response its score drew when it was made; a response rule added later applies from the next evaluation or a recalculation (F-P15-2).

### ScorecardDetail

| SupplierRisk | dialog | Record actionable risk and response | supplier, organization, severity, category, owner, effective/expiry, evidence, action/reason | existing work-item link | proposed `mantle.party.SupplierServices.store#SupplierRisk` | Carbon supplier risk evaluation |

**Actions and states.** OTD measures against the committed delivery date, the first supplier-acknowledged line date when an acknowledgement exists, else the PO line `OrderItem.requiredByDate`, with the latest supplier promise shown separately; it counts receipt events per line, not shipments, by AssetReceipt.receivedDate, weighted by eligible ordered/received quantity; exclude cancelled remainder explicitly. Five eligible receipts is the ScorePolicy default minimum before a weighted score can drive a block, editable per policy (impl-purchasing §4). Quality score uses dispositions, including rejected quantity, not shipment delivered status. Price variance compares agreed price versus billed amount in a documented UOM/FX basis. Response time starts at successful invitation delivery. Each measure exposes missing/late evidence; corrections produce a new evaluation. Proposed procurement blocks are scoped, reasoned and overridable only by policy capability.

As built (impl-purchasing P15): the first acknowledged date is the first audit-logged value of the line's promised date; quality is the received quantity less the dock rejection and the scrap, rework and return-to-supplier dispositions of its inspections (an undecided inspection leaves its receipt out, use as is counts good); price variance is the absolute billed-to-ordered difference over the ordered amount in the order's currency and line unit (a bill in another currency is left out, F-P15-3); response counts an invitation from its first sent email and answered by the RFQ's response date. A block's override is ending its rule or the risk, or a newer evaluation; there is no per-document override (F-P15-2).

**Actions and states.** Use Accounting commitment lineage and source state: request reservation converts to PO commitment and then actual without double counting. The rows read Accounting's proposed `mantle.other.budget.BudgetCommitment` (D10). Purchasing calls `reserve#Commitment` at request approval, `convert#Commitment` (request to PO) at PO approval and `release#Commitment` on cancel or close; Accounting's `approve#Payable` converts PO to actual. Warn/Stop results are visible but only finance policy can change them. Exports run the identical authorized query and include filters, snapshot time and omitted-data warnings.

SupplierClassifications maintains the values themselves as PartyClassification rows of a proposed supplier-category classification type (seed `PcltSupplierCategory`, proposed; R-PUR-29). Match and bill policy link to Accounting's `Accounting/Settings/MatchPolicies`; settlement terms use Agreement/SettlementTerm.

### PurchasePolicy

**Layout.** settings with the effective-dated policy rows and preview.

**Forms.**

**Actions and states.** PurchasePolicy is effective-dated rows by organization with its key fields audit-logged (impl-purchasing §4); built in impl-purchasing P2 with the defaults and the controls other than the substitution and recurring-release rules, which P9 and P13 add with their readers (F-P2-3); P9 added the substitution rule, `substitutionEnumId`, not allowed by default; P14b `planBuyToRequest` (No by default): SupplyPlanning's buy conversion makes a purchase request sent for approval instead of a draft purchase order (crosscut §4.2). Administrator previews impacted open documents and starts a row from a date, which ends the current row; the earlier row stays with its history. A document keeps the policy row it was evaluated against, and the time, until explicit revalidation. The approval gate's flag, off by default, turns on `check#PurchaseApprovalRequired` for the organization (§6; impl-accounting §4). Purchase administrators cannot weaken match, stock or budget controls; show effective shared policy and owner link. Match policy belongs to Accounting at `Accounting/Settings/MatchPolicies`, written through proposed `MatchServices.store#MatchPolicy` over the proposed `mantle.account.invoice.InvoiceMatchPolicy`: organization, product category or product override, bill basis (ordered or received), receipt required, quantity, price and tax tolerance, same-rate action, service-acceptance rule, self-billing default, as effective-dated rows (D4; R-PUR-08; impl-accounting §4). Disabling purchasing automation leaves manually created requests and current orders usable.

### ApprovalPolicies

**Layout.** settings list and policy detail forms.

**Forms.**

| Form | Kind | Purpose | Highlighted fields | Widgets of note | Services | Derived from |

| ApprovalPolicyList | list | Find effective source approval rules | organization, source type, amount band/currency, category/facility, effective dates | effective-dated rows | proposed `ironstone.purchasing.ApprovalServices.find#PurchaseApprovalPolicies` | Carbon purchasing approval settings; Odoo two-step approval |
| ApprovalPolicy | single | Define revision-bound approvers | organization, request/award/PO, threshold/currency, sequence, approver role/user, quorum, self-approval, expiry | party lookup and overlap validation | proposed `mantle.order.PurchaseServices.store#PurchaseApprovalPolicy` | Carbon purchasing approvals; Odoo approval threshold |
| ApprovalPreview | display | Explain rule and commitment decision | source revision, converted amount, selected tiers, eligible approvers, budget Warn/Stop | read-only preview with missing-policy error | proposed `mantle.order.PurchaseServices.preview#PurchaseApproval` | Carbon approval setup preview |

**Actions and states.** PurchaseApprovalPolicy is effective-dated rows with their key fields audit-logged (impl-purchasing §4). Policy activation requires administrator authority and rejects ambiguous bands or no eligible approver. Thresholds ship as decided (impl-purchasing §4): no monetary auto-approval outside explicitly configured policy, a buyer and manager split to start, and a visible Warn budget policy, with finance choosing Stop per budget. With no active policy for an organization and source type, one approval step by the purchase-approver capability applies, and self-approval needs an explicit setting, so a one-person business can still approve (R-PUR-14). Proposed PurchaseApprovalDecision, a record of its own, records source entity/ID/revision, the policy row and the time it was evaluated, approver, decision, date and reason; the business source remains authoritative. A change to an audit-logged key field of a placed source after its decision invalidates the decision and resubmits notifications. Request approval does not invent ReqApproved; ReqReviewed remains reviewed. Budget checks/commitment lock at approval use Accounting AC-14 BudgetControlPolicy and its `BudgetServices.check#Budget`, `reserve#Commitment`, `convert#Commitment` and `release#Commitment` (D10). Separate duty prevents buyer self-approval when required and does not imply finance payable approval.

As built (impl-purchasing P4): a row is one step of a band (from included, to not included) in its currency, optionally for
a category or facility; its approver is a user, else a user group's members, else any purchase approver of the organization,
each holding PURCHASE_APPROVE; quorum distinct approvers decide it; `separateApprover` keeps an earlier step's approver off it;
self-approval is the step's setting, else the buying policy's; expiry days bound how long a step's approval counts while
later steps wait. Bands of one scope meet or are the same. A band applies in its own currency only: nothing converts an amount
(F-P4-3). The budget is checked and reserved by account, the line's override account else the one its bill posts to.

**Actions and states.** Default response is warn and assign review; blocking needs explicit approved rule, adequate data and authorized override path. Unsupported arbitrary score formulas and external risk feeds are later integrations; initial criteria are OTD, acceptance rate, price variance and response time with documented denominators.

As built (impl-purchasing P15): with no response rule an evaluation draws nothing (Mantle's default). A rule is a score band and/or a risk severity with one effect for RFQs and purchase orders alike (Warn, Warn and review, Block), applied by the buying policy's supplier check; no reviewer role, expiry or follow-up work item yet (F-P15-2, §18). A measure scores 100 at its target and 0 at its floor, straight between; built-in weights 40, 30, 20 and 10, targets 95%, 99%, 0% and 100%, floors 70%, 90%, 10% and 50%. The response measure is the RFQ response rate by the response date, not a time.

## 13. Supplier access

These are bounded supplier pages under the common [external access contract](design-crosscut.md#5-external-access-and-shared-configuration).
They do not create a complete Commerce design. An authenticated supplier relationship or
expiring, revocable record-bound capability controls supplier, buying organization, document,
revision, operations and attachment visibility. The internal Purchasing root grant is not a
supplier grant. Invalid/revoked links reveal no supplier/document metadata; a forged route or
supplier ID cannot widen scope. Existing Projects intake tokens are project/request intake,
not general supplier access; this is an explicit extension using their isolation conventions.
Server authorization occurs before loading documents or attachments and again on submission.

**App and links** (impl-purchasing §4, reversing D5's supplier root; R-PUR-12, R-SB-14). Public-facing
pages are in mr-pass and internal ones in mr-boss. The supplier pages are Purchasing's pages in the PASS
Supplier app (`screen/Supplier.xml`, the `supplier` mount), which Accounting starts with BillUpload, on
PASS's foundation (design-forum §1, §4, §5): PASS's shell and mounts, at 390 px and on the desktop, with
no terminal UI. There is no `screen/SupplierPortal.xml` in BOSS and no `BOSS_SUPPLIER_PORTAL` group. A
signed-in supplier contact is a PASS public account with no UserGroup, invited from Supplier360 through
a PASS invitation bound to the Supplier app and the supplier; redeeming it makes the supplier
relationship Mantle checks, and the contact reaches the list on SupplierHome. Pages call only Mantle
services through `pass.Facade.call#Operation`, each an operation in PASS's `Schema.js` and `Routes.js`
served by Mantle's PassApi, so the same pages work with a local or remote authority. Its pages are
`SupplierHome`, `QuoteResponse`, `OrderAcknowledgement` and Accounting's `BillUpload`, the one
SupplierBillUpload page for both apps. A single-record link is a page of the Supplier app taking its
token, on the buying organization's site, not a MoquiConf token route: QuoteResponse for a quote order,
and the PO's page, whose one capability covers OrderAcknowledgement and BillUpload. Each token is checked
by `mantle.party.ExternalAccessServices.check#AccessToken` (built, Accounting P18), and PASS's throttling limits
the posts. Capabilities are created and revoked through `create#AccessCapability` and
`revoke#AccessCapability` over the `mantle.party.ExternalAccessCapability` record (built, Accounting P18)
(record entity, ID and revision, party, scope, expiry, revokedDate, token digest). The proposed
`mantle.order.SupplierPortalServices` call `check#AccessCapability` first and keep no token rules of
their own; where an acknowledgement or quote response is a BOSS service, its core moves into Mantle,
since PASS reaches no BOSS service. Quote and acknowledgement attachments go through PASS's media
staging and scanning into OrderContent. Buyers enter quotes and acknowledgements on the supplier's
behalf first, so the internal path is complete without these pages (impl-purchasing §4).

### SupplierHome

**Layout.** landing of published RFQs, POs and submitted bills in the authorized supplier scope.

**Actions and states.** A signed-in supplier contact may list documents allowed by its supplier relationship; a single-record capability shows only that record and permitted next steps. It cannot enumerate RFQs, competitors, internal requests, costs, other parties or private files. There is no terminal view (PASS); a private emailed token is never logged.

| SubmitResponse | dialog | Confirm supplier submission | quote order and RFQ revision, operation ID, consent to terms, submitted time | preview and confirm | proposed `mantle.order.SupplierPortalServices.submit#QuoteResponse` | ERPNext supplier quotation portal; Carbon share supplier quote |

**Actions and states.** Save draft is private to the supplier and authorized buyer policy; submit moves the supplier's quote order to OrderProposed, an audit-logged change, as a claim for internal review, and notifies the buyer. Its quantity tiers become price rows only when a buyer publishes them (§5 QuoteDetail). Late response is visibly late and is accepted, marked late for the buyer (a policy flag refusing it is later, impl-purchasing F-P16-8); a draft is the supplier's own record, never a write to the quote (F-P16-5); a stale or cancelled quote order refuses mutation and offers the current one if separately authorized. Repeated submit returns prior receipt. The supplier cannot set approval, award, other supplier, buyer price maximum or source-demand fields. The page shows the RFQ as last sent to the supplier (its specification, due date, lines and revision as of that send, read back from the audit log as the as-of print is), so a buyer's edit not yet sent is not shown, and the supplier answers that revision until the buyer sends again (impl-purchasing P17, F176).

**Needs.** PUR-PORTAL, PUR-RFQ, CX-PORTALS.

### OrderAcknowledgement

**Layout.** task for one published PO revision with per-line promise.

**Forms.**

| Form | Kind | Purpose | Highlighted fields | Widgets of note | Services | Derived from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PublishedPurchaseOrder | display | Read sent PO and public documents | PO revision, buyer/supplier, ordered items, qty/UOM, price, due, terms | html-print link | proposed `mantle.order.SupplierPortalServices.get#PublishedPurchaseOrder` | ERPNext Purchase Order confirmation; Carbon purchase share |
| AcknowledgeOrder | single | Confirm or propose changes to current revision | supplier ref/date, accept/reject, per-line confirmed qty/date, exception reason, attachment, operation ID | old/requested date beside response | proposed `mantle.order.SupplierPortalServices.acknowledge#PurchaseOrder` | Odoo receipt date confirmation; ERPNext confirmation fields |

**Actions and states.** Submit acknowledges exact revision, writing the audit-logged acknowledgement fields of §6 Acknowledgements. Partial/rejected or changed promise routes to buyer review and does not update PO price/quantity, create stock or approve payment. An older revision's link returns SupersededRevision and never acknowledges a newer PO implicitly; the link names its revision (`ExternalAccessCapability.recordRevision`), and the same PO link, of any revision, opens BillUpload, since a bill is for the order (impl-purchasing F-P16-1). A drop-ship delivery report is kept as the order's content for the buyer to confirm. A drop-ship supplier reports delivery from this page, and the buyer confirms it (§6 Drop-ship). Phone shows one line at a time with the same final summary. For subcontract POs, show only this supplier's service lines, company-owned component custody, due dates and approved dispatch/inspection evidence. The same supplier-facing contract can be mounted for standalone Manufacturing; supplier confirmations are claims for internal review and never post stock receipts or verify quality.



**Source.** research §5; Odoo purchase reminders; ERPNext purchase_order.json confirmation fields.

**Needs.** PUR-PORTAL, PUR-ORDER.

### SupplierBillUpload

**Context passed.** Accounting's BillUpload page in the PASS Supplier app, `PASS: Supplier/BillUpload`, once for Purchasing and Accounting; Purchasing adds OrderAcknowledgement beside it on the same PO link (impl-purchasing §4; impl-accounting §4); [Accounting §5 SupplierBillUpload](design-accounting.md#supplierbillupload) and crosscut §5. There is no second supplier URL for it. Fix supplier and buying organization from verified external scope. Show only own published eligible PO references; upload reference/date/currency/amount/source file using `mantle.account.PortalServices.submit#SupplierBill` (built, Accounting P18) and `get#Submission`, which make the incoming draft through `import#Bill`'s Mantle core. Duplicate capability submission/reference returns the original receipt. This creates incoming bill evidence for AP, never a financial approval or permission to inspect unrelated invoice/payment data. For a self-billing supplier the upload attaches its evidence to the receipt-generated draft instead of creating a second bill (D2). PASS shares identity, media and status receipt across its customer and supplier apps; no separate Purchasing invoice-intake model.

**Needs.** PUR-PORTAL, AC-02.

## 14. Baseline coverage and validation

### 14.1 Source status and reference evidence

The active XML parser/source check excludes comments. These distinctions are implementation gates,
not unresolved design alternatives:

| Source | Verified behavior | Design consequence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `entity/RequestEntities.xml`; `service/mantle/request/RequestServices.xml` | RqtPurchase and Request/RequestItem/RequestItemOrder exist; Request item has no quantityUomId; links, intake and request-to-work services are active | Extend units, the line cost centre, audit-logged item fields and purchase completion policy; the organization is a RequestParty role; reuse current Projects screen and links. RqtPurchaseRfq is proposed. |
| `service/mantle/order/OrderServices.xml` create#PurchaseRequestOrder | Requires facility, groups supplier items, returns early on missing supplier, scalar outputs; no per-supplier result collection; iterates every RequestItem on each call without checking RequestItemOrder; `placeAndApproveOrders` places and approves | PUR-REQUEST's `convert#PurchaseSourcing` is required before mixed-success sourcing; the existing primitive stays unchanged for its Mantle callers (impl-purchasing F4). Do not claim it meets that contract. No context calls it directly (R-PUR-01). |
| `service/mantle/order/OrderInfoServices.xml` send#OrderStoreEmail | Returns without sending when the order has no ProductStore; recipient defaults to the part's customer party; skips an email type already sent | POs are sent by proposed `send#PurchaseOrder` (R-PUR-02). |
| `service/mantle/order/OrderServices.xml` cancel#OrderItem, complete#Order | cancel#OrderItem defaults its quantity to what is not yet issued, from AssetIssuance; complete#Order only sets OrderCompleted | `close#PurchaseRemainders` always passes an explicit cancelQuantity (R-PUR-03). |
| `service/mantle/order/OrderServices.xml` autoApprove#Order; `service/OrderReturn.secas.xml` | OrderPlaced runs autoApprove#Order for POs too; it approves when payments cover the total and check#OrderPreApprove adds no warning | Proposed `check#PurchaseApprovalRequired` adds the warning (R-SB-10). |
| `service/mantle/product/PriceServices.xml` modify#ProductPrice | A `type="interface"` hook in the resolver pipeline, not a store service | Supplier prices are written through Products' proposed `store#ProductPrice` (R-PUR-04). |
| `entity/OrderEntities.xml` status flow | OrderBeingChanged only from OrderOpen or OrderProposed; Placed, Processing and Approved can go to Hold; no Sent → Hold; Approved → Placed reruns the OrderPlaced SECAs | Revisions and buyer holds lock with OrderHold and a proposed OrderHoldReason (R-PUR-05, R-SB-07). |
| `entity/ProductDefinitionEntities.xml`; `service/mantle/product/PriceServices.xml` | ProductPrice contains supplier code/name, lead time, quantityUomId, agreement and parties; one active resolver | Use correct purchase party direction and Products rule/trace extension; no duplicated supplier catalog engine. |
| `entity/PartyEntities.xml` | Agreement/AgreementItem/AgreementTerm active; no AgrPurchase purchase lifecycle seed | Add purchase type, approval, audit-logged caps and release allocations; retain existing term/content primitives. |
| `entity/OrderEntities.xml` | OrderHeader.orderRevision and OrderPart supplier reference fields active; the audit log covers OrderItem's product, quantity, required date and unit amount and OrderPart's status and parties, not `orderRevision` or the supplier reference (impl-purchasing F18) | Change and acknowledgement history come from the audit log once the locked fields have `enable-audit-log`; approval invalidation is proposed; no revision or acknowledgement record. |
| `entity/OrderEntities.xml` quote status flow | OrderOpen → OrderRequested ("Request Quote") → OrderProposed ("Propose Quote") → OrderPlaced ("Place from Quote"); Requested → Rejected; Proposed → Cancelled ("Cancel Quote") (impl-purchasing F19) | A supplier quote is a purchase order in these statuses, and an award places it (§5). |
| Moqui Java `dropship-moqui` branch of mantle-udm and mantle-usl, never merged into master (impl-purchasing F21) | `FcTpDropShip`, `Facility.dropShipRemoteId`, `create#DropShipPurchaseOrder` beside `reserve#AssetsForOrder`, `finalize#DropShipPurchaseOrder`; it places and approves the PO itself | Ported into mr-mantle, with BOSS's approval gate behind its flag (§6 Drop-ship). |
| `entity/ShipmentEntities.xml`; `entity/ProductAssetEntities.xml` | Shipment/order source links and accepted/rejected AssetReceipt quantities active | Shared quality holds/disposition and receipt-specific return allocation need additions. |
| `service/mantle/account/InvoiceServices.xml`; `AccountingInvoice.secas.xml` | Active invoice source application and purchase-shipment invoice creation exist; at ShipDelivered the SECA bills accepted plus rejected quantity, with quarantined units as accepted | PUR-MATCH supplies locking/tolerances/hold controls; the receipt SECA runs only for self-billing suppliers with accepted-only billing (R-SB-01; D2). |
| `service/mantle/order/ReturnServices.xml` calculate#OrderItemReturnable; `service/mantle/shipment/ShipmentServices.xml` receive#EntireShipment | Returnable quantity is billed quantity minus returned quantity; receive#EntireShipment accepts every unhandled unit and delivers | Supplier returns use proposed `find#ReturnableReceipts` (R-SB-06); short receipts use `close#ReceiptRemainder` (R-SB-11). |
| `service/mantle/product/InventoryReportServices.xml` | Projected inventory/price history depend on indexed documents | Expose freshness/completeness; revalidate current transactional demand/supply before creation. |
| Framework `moqui.basic.UomConversion` | fromDate/thruDate already exist on conversion | Use dated UomConversion; do not invent UomConversionDated. |
| `service/mantle/shipment/CarrierServices.xml`; ledger services | get#ShipmentRates and calculate#GlJournalTrialBalance definitions are commented out although the inventory lists them | Do not label them active or use them as Purchasing dependencies. Supplier shipping rates remain an explicit shared integration need. |

Concrete local references inspected for this design include:

- `odoo/odoo/addons/purchase/views/purchase_views.xml`: confirmed-PO locks, approval buttons,
  supplier selector, receipt reminder and acknowledgement-date controls.
- `frappe/erpnext/erpnext/buying/doctype/request_for_quotation/request_for_quotation.json`:
  multi-supplier recipients, item specifications, terms, shipping/billing and attachment publishing.
- `frappe/erpnext/erpnext/buying/doctype/supplier_quotation/supplier_quotation.json`:
  supplier reference, currency/conversion, validity, quantity/price lines and terms.
- `carbon/apps/erp/app/modules/purchasing/ui/SupplierQuote/SupplierQuoteCompareDrawer.tsx`:
  compare quantity tiers then select items; BOSS uses XML split/lists for the same task.
- `frappe/erpnext/erpnext/buying/doctype/purchase_order/purchase_order.json`:
  confirmation number/date, shipping/dropship and subcontracting source fields.
- `frappe/erpnext/erpnext/buying/doctype/buying_settings/buying_settings.json`:
  PO/receipt requirements, same-rate policy, over-order/transfer and rejected-quantity controls.
- `frappe/erpnext/erpnext/buying/doctype/supplier_scorecard/supplier_scorecard.json`:
  criterion weights, score periods and explicit warning/prevention flags.
- `frappe/erpnext/erpnext/templates/pages/rfq.py`: supplier-to-RFQ membership check and limited
  response payload; BOSS additionally binds each invitation to a revision and allowed operations.

### 14.2 Research candidate and question disposition

| Research area/candidate | Screen disposition | Scope and decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| §1 Home/work queue | Home | new; actionable counts, assigned work and links, including shortfall suggestions and quotes expiring (R-PUR-28); no proprietary dashboard dependency |
| §2 Supplier 360, supplier products/prices, documents and risks | Suppliers, Supplier360, SupplierPrices, ScorecardDetail | parity identity/prices; new profile/risk and supplier approval status (R-PUR-15); financial bank edits remain separately authorized |
| §3 Internal requisition, demand triage and convert | Requests, RequestDetail, RequestSourcing | parity request forms; new approval/provenance/batch conversion |
| §4 RFQ, supplier quotes, compare, award, vendor pages | QuoteRequests, QuoteRequestDetail, Quotes, QuoteDetail, QuoteComparison, Award, QuoteResponse | new; purchase-specific Request type, and supplier quotes as purchase orders in the quote statuses; no use of customer RqtQuote |
| §5 POs, revision/approval/lock/acknowledgement, blanket/template, leases | PurchaseOrders, OrderDetail, OrderChanges, Acknowledgements, Approvals, Agreements, AgreementDetail, LeaseOverview | parity order/agreement forms; new controls; later Accounting-owned lease schedule |
| §6 Replenishment/min-max/MRP and automation | SupplyPlanning, InventoryAvailability, ReorderRules | parity stock policy/availability; new common planning, never a second buyer-only MRP engine |
| §7 Expected receipts, inspection, supplier return, shipping | Receipts, ShipmentDetail, Inspections, QualityInspection, InspectionTemplates, Returns, ReturnDetail | parity receipt/return primitives; new shared inspection/holds and receipt allocation; advanced NCR/CAPA later shared quality extension |
| §8 Bills, PO-receipt match, PDF extraction, payables handoff | Bills, InvoiceDetail, MatchExceptions, InvoiceMatch, SupplierBillUpload | parity bills; new match/hold/intake controls; later OCR within Accounting intake; payments reused through granted shared actions |
| §9 Performance/analytics, statement, risk | Scorecards, ScorecardDetail, Spend, Commitments, ProcurementTracker, PurchaseHistory, SupplierStatement | new; evidence-based XML reports; later arbitrary analytics via Insights and external risk feeds |
| §10 Settings/classification/terms/supplier prices | Settings, PurchasePolicy, ApprovalPolicies, ScorecardPolicies, Supplier360, AgreementDetail, SupplierPrices | parity source classification/terms/prices, new effective policies; supplier categories in Settings SupplierClassifications (R-PUR-29); receipt-before-bill and same-rate rules in Accounting's MatchPolicies (R-PUR-08); shared owner controls stock/finance |
| §11 Cross-app surfaces | Shared contexts and shell providers | current Commons/Projects implementations reused; terminal/handheld and standalone use explicit |
| §12 Baseline and §13 model/sequencing/questions | §14.1, §14.3, §16–§18 | Every candidate accounted for; no absent data or framework capability represented as existing |

Research §13's six open questions are resolved in §17: purchase RFQ representation,
shared purchase request granularity, supplier portal conventions, agreement model, source
approval model and shared replenishment/MRP. The review items once in §18 are decided in §17
from impl-purchasing §4; the two left, the advanced integrations and vendor consignment, are
`later` (impl-purchasing §5, §7).

### 14.3 Baseline form coverage

The exact additive inventory map accompanies this document's review. The following rows are
the bounded purchasing ownership/context mapping; unrelated sales promotions, gateway payment
operations and specialized customer statements remain with their corresponding app designs.
Form names are inventory names, even where several nested forms share a screen XML name.

| Baseline screen family | Forms covered / relevant boundary | Purchasing path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Supplier/FindSupplier | CreatePersonForm, CreateOrganizationForm, OuterSearchForm, SupplierListForm | Purchasing/Suppliers |
| Party/EditParty and contact/identity, role/classification/detail forms | Supplier360 shares party identity/contact/address/roles/classifications and authorized financial summaries; bank writes require finance grant | Purchasing/Suppliers/Supplier360 |
| Catalog/Product/EditPrices | NewPriceForm, PricesForm | Purchasing/Suppliers/SupplierPrices |
| Request/FindRequest | NewRequestForm, ListRequests | Purchasing/Requests |
| Request/EditRequest; EditRequestItems; request comments/content/related work | EditRequest, AddPartyForm, UpdatePartyForm, NewRequestItemForm, RequestItemListForm; current shared notes/files/work links; sourcing extension of create#PurchaseRequestOrder | Purchasing/Requests/RequestDetail; Purchasing/Requests/RequestSourcing |
| Order/FindOrder | CreatePurchaseOrder, OrderList, ApproveOrdersForm, CloseOrdersForm | Purchasing/Orders/PurchaseOrders |
| Order/OrderDetail; OrderItems | Header/part/item creation/edit, revision/audit, close remainder, recurrence, send/evidence, source shipment links; promotional code and customer gateway forms excluded | Purchasing/Orders/OrderDetail; Purchasing/Orders/OrderChanges |
| Party/FindAgreement; EditAgreement | NewAgreement, AgreementList; EditAgreement, AddSettlementTerm, AddOtherTerm, AgreementTermList, AddAgreementItem, AgreementItemList, NewContentForm, UpdateContentForm | Purchasing/Agreements; Purchasing/Agreements/AgreementDetail |
| Facility/EditFacilityProducts | AddProductForm, ProductList | Purchasing/Replenishment/ReorderRules |
| Shipment/FindShipment, ShipmentDetail and ReceiveItem | Purchase source search, shipment/header/contents, receipt item/lot quantities and carrier/progress read context; full pack/ship parity is Warehouse-owned | Purchasing/Receiving/Receipts; Purchasing/Receiving/ShipmentDetail |
| Return/FindReturn, EditReturn, EditReturnItems, AddOrderItems | Supplier create/list/header/item/eligible source quantities through ReturnDetail | Purchasing/Returns; Purchasing/Returns/ReturnDetail |
| Accounting/Invoice/FindInvoice, EditInvoice, EditInvoiceItemOrders, EditInvoiceItemShipments | InvoiceList and bill header/items, order/receipt allocation and payment summary through shared screens; finance mutations require finance capability | Purchasing/Bills; Purchasing/Bills/InvoiceDetail; Purchasing/Bills/InvoiceMatch |

### 14.4 End-to-end acceptance

These are design acceptance scenarios to exercise during implementation. Documentation review
checks the stated ownership/contracts now; it does not claim an executable business test passed.

| Scenario | Required result / partial failure |
| --- | --- |
| Variant → supplier pack price → request/RFQ → split award → PO → partial receipt/inspection → split bill → payment | Order actual variant in dated pack conversion; freeze offer/approval revision. One supplier group can fail SupplierBlocked while another creates a draft PO. Receive 8/10 into quality hold, inspect seven accepted and one rejected; only the seven disposed/released accepted units are eligible. Price variance creates hold; match operator allocates, finance releases/approves/pays. Original source quantities and remaining 2 ordered reconcile. |
| Shortage → shared buy/make/transfer plan → partial production → stock/GL | One common requirement ledger subtracts existing PO/production/transfer allocation. Concurrent conversion yields DemandAlreadyCovered for one item. Make creates WeInPlanning draft; separate release fixes BOM. Manufacturing issue/completion costs and Accounting valuation/GL link back without treating quote/RFQ as supply. |
| Sales order reservation → pick shortfall → alternate buy/transfer → pack/ship/invoice | Shortfall leaves explicit demand/backorder; no buyer action releases reserved stock. Authorized substitute confirms product/UOM/specification and customer requirement. New supply is linked once; Warehouse and Accounting perform their own physical and financial postings. |
| Customer case → RMA → disposition → vendor return and supplier credit/replacement | Customer settlement remains Customer Service/Accounting contract; procurement may create a linked supplier return for eligible source receipt. Supplier dispatch does not complete customer refund or create a second credit. Net billed/paid/returned quantities cap settlement; supplier replacement has a separate linked PO/expected receipt. |
| Count → intervening movement → variance → posting/retry | Shared count session snapshots movement/version; an intervening receipt/issue raises a conflict and requires recount by default. Explicitly authorized movement reconciliation is an audited exception, never silent recomputation from a stale count. Buyer projected availability reflects posted adjustment, never a raw counted value. Retry returns same posting; rejected independent count lines remain named failures. |
| Case intake → assignment → SLA pause/reopen → resolution/CSAT | Purchasing supplier follow-up links existing Request/WorkItem; it does not redefine Customer Service SLA or auto-close the customer case when a PO/receipt changes. Supplier visibility never includes customer-private case notes. |
| Cancellation, failed inspection and substitution | Cancel RFQ revokes the quote orders' capabilities but retains offers; cancel PO remainder releases only unused demand/commitment; posted receipts/bills require linked corrections. Failed inspection holds stock and match quantity. Substitute cannot mutate released BOM or existing received identity. |
| Closed period, unauthorized action and standalone use | Period-locked bill correction is refused or posted by authorized correction in an open period with lineage. Forged supplier/app/organization context is denied. A user with Purchasing plus receiving/finance capabilities completes work from shared mounts without Warehouse/Accounting root grants; without them sees request/handoff action only. |
| Named independent failures, atomic inner posting | Imports, supplier groups, RFQ emails, batch approvals and reports name each failing row/document and continue independent work. Within a stock movement, award/source allocation or invoice/credit posting, all quantity/value/source/hold effects commit or roll back together. Timeout/retry resolves operation identity before further mutation. |
| Drop-ship sales line → drop-ship PO → supplier confirmation → customer invoice and supplier bill | A line reserved at the supplier's drop-ship facility makes a PO whose parent is the sales order, shipping to the customer; a line reserved in the warehouse stays there. The PO waits for approval. Confirming delivery with a tracking code ships the PO's shipment and the sales shipment and invoices the customer once; a retry changes nothing. The buyer's stock is unchanged, and the supplier bill matches against the shipped delivery. |
| A revision and its as-of print | A sent PO revised below its received quantity is refused; an approved revision goes out with its PDF stored, and the PO printed as of a time before it shows the earlier quantities. The RFQ and the agreement print as of a time the same way. |

### 14.5 Exact additive inventory map

Each row below adds its Purchasing path to **Designed in**; earlier paths and all **Implemented in** values remain unchanged. Shared forms remain defined by their canonical owner. Item/receipt/financial forms are contextual reuse and still require their independent action capabilities.

| Inventory section / screen | Forms | Designed in addition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Supplier/FindSupplier | `CreatePersonForm`, `CreateOrganizationForm`, `OuterSearchForm`, `SupplierListForm` | `Purchasing/Suppliers` |
| Party/EditParty | `EditOrganizationForm`, `EditPersonForm`, `AddDirectRoleForm`, `AddOtherRoleForm`, `RolesForm`, `SetClassificationForm`, `ClassificationsForm`, `AddIdentificationForm`, `IdentificationsForm`, `AddContactAssignForm`, `CreateContactForm`, `ContactRelList`, `NewNoteForm`, `UpdateNoteForm`, `OtherCreateForm`, `PhonePurposeForm`, `EmailPurposeForm`, `WebPurposeForm`, `OtherUpdateForm`, `OtherPurposeForm`, `PostalPurposeForm`, `NewContentForm`, `UpdateContentForm` | `Purchasing/Suppliers/Supplier360` |
| Party/FinancialInfo | `UnpaidPayablesList`, `OutgoingPaymentList`, `PurchaseOrderList`, `PaidPayablesList` | `Purchasing/Suppliers/Supplier360` |
| Catalog/EditPrices | `NewPriceForm`, `PricesForm` | `Purchasing/Suppliers/SupplierPrices` |
| Request/EditRequest | `EditRequest`, `AddCommentForm`, `AddPartyForm`, `UpdatePartyForm`, `NewNoteForm`, `UpdateNoteForm`, `NewContentForm`, `UpdateContentForm`, `RequestTaskList` | `Purchasing/Requests/RequestDetail` |
| Request/RequestCommentReply | `ReplyCommentForm` | `Purchasing/Requests/RequestDetail` |
| Request/RequestCommentUpdate | `ReplyCommentForm` | `Purchasing/Requests/RequestDetail` |
| Request/EditRequestItems | `NewRequestItemForm`, `RequestItemListForm` | `Purchasing/Requests/RequestDetail` |
| Request/EditTasks | `AddRweForm`, `NewTaskForm`, `UpdateRweForm` | `Purchasing/Requests/RequestDetail` |
| Request/EditUsers | `AddUserForm`, `UpdateUserForm` | `Purchasing/Requests/RequestDetail` |
| Request/EditWikiPages | `AddWprForm`, `DeleteWprForm` | `Purchasing/Requests/RequestDetail` |
| Request/FindRequest | `NewRequestForm`, `ListRequests` | `Purchasing/Requests` |
| Order/FindOrder | `ApproveOrdersForm`, `CloseOrdersForm`, `CreatePurchaseOrder`, `OrderList` | `Purchasing/Orders/PurchaseOrders` |

| Order/EditItem | `EditOrderItem` | `Purchasing/Orders/OrderDetail` |
| Order/OrderItems | `AddProductItemForm`, `AddOtherItemForm`, `OrderItems` | `Purchasing/Orders/OrderDetail` |
| Party/FindAgreement | `NewAgreement`, `AgreementList` | `Purchasing/Agreements` |
| Party/EditAgreement | `EditAgreement`, `AddSettlementTerm`, `AddOtherTerm`, `AgreementTermList`, `AddAgreementItem`, `AgreementItemList`, `NewContentForm`, `UpdateContentForm` | `Purchasing/Agreements/AgreementDetail` |
| Facility/EditFacilityProducts | `AddProductForm`, `ProductList` | `Purchasing/Replenishment/ReorderRules` |
| Shipment/FindShipment | `ShipmentList` | `Purchasing/Receiving/Receipts` |
| Shipment/ShipmentDetail | `AuditLogList`, `EditShipment`, `ItemLimitForm`, `ShipmentOrderPaymentList`, `ShipmentInvoicePaymentList`, `AddParty`, `RolesForm`, `NewContentForm`, `UpdateContentForm`, `SendPlacedEmailForm`, `EmailMessageList`, `AddItemForm` | `Purchasing/Receiving/ShipmentDetail` |
| Shipment/ReceiveItem | `ReceiveForm` | `Purchasing/Receiving/ShipmentDetail` |
| Shipment/ShipmentItems | `AddItemForm`, `ItemsOptionsForm`, `UpdateItemForm`, `ItemSourceReceiptList`, `ItemAssetReceiptList` | `Purchasing/Receiving/ShipmentDetail` |
| Return/FindReturn | `CreateSupplierReturn`, `ReturnHeaderList` | `Purchasing/Returns` |
| Return/EditReturn | `AuditLogList`, `UpdateReturn` | `Purchasing/Returns/ReturnDetail` |
| Return/EditReturnItems | `ReturnItemList` | `Purchasing/Returns/ReturnDetail` |
| Return/AddOrderItems | `LookBackDaysForm`, `AddOrderItemToReturn` | `Purchasing/Returns/ReturnDetail` |
| Accounting/FindInvoice | `InvoiceList` | `Purchasing/Bills` |
| Accounting/EditInvoice | `OutSystemMessageList`, `AuditLogList`, `EditInvoice`, `NewContentForm`, `UpdateContentForm`, `EmailMessageList`, `PaymentApplicationList`, `OrderPromisedPaymentList`, `InvoiceTxList`, `InvoiceGlaList` | `Purchasing/Bills/InvoiceDetail` |
| Accounting/EditInvoiceItemDetails | `AddDetailForm`, `AssetItemDetailList`, `FacilityItemDetailList`, `ItemDetailList` | `Purchasing/Bills/InvoiceDetail` |
| Accounting/EditInvoiceItems | `CreateInvoiceItem`, `EditInvoiceItems` | `Purchasing/Bills/InvoiceDetail` |
| Accounting/EditInvoiceItemOrders | `ApplyToOrder`, `ApplyItemToOrder`, `ItemBillingList` | `Purchasing/Bills/InvoiceMatch` |
| Accounting/EditInvoiceItemShipments | `ApplyToShipment`, `ApplyItemToShipment`, `ItemSourceList` | `Purchasing/Bills/InvoiceMatch` |

Existing service mappings add only direct documented calls/context primitives. Proposed services have no inventory rows yet. The purchase-shipment invoice SECA is a source behavior dependency, not a new screen call.

## 15. Documents and outputs

| Output | Kind | From screen | Derived from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RFQ and supplier invitation | html-print/PDF as of a time and reviewed email with the QuoteResponse link; the published RFQ's PDF stored as RequestContent | QuoteRequestDetail | ERPNext RFQ print/message/attachment choices; Commons delivery/outbox |
| Supplier offer/award comparison | html-print and CSV export with original/normalized basis | QuoteDetail; QuoteComparison; Award | Carbon quote comparison; ERPNext supplier quotation |
| PO, revision and supplier acknowledgement | html-print/PDF as of a date and time and reviewed email through proposed `send#PurchaseOrder`, with the PASS Supplier app's PO link for acknowledgement and bill upload; the sent revision's PDF stored as OrderContent | OrderDetail; OrderChanges; Acknowledgements | Order/PrintOrder; Odoo purchase report and reminder |
| Drop-ship PO | html-print/PDF with the customer's ship-to address and no buyer receiving address | OrderDetail | Order/PrintOrder |
| Regret notice to suppliers not awarded | reviewed email, per-recipient outcome | Award CloseSolicitation | Odoo purchase_alternative warning |
| Agreement/terms and release history | html-print/PDF as of a date; the approved agreement's PDF stored as AgreementContent; authorized attachment download | AgreementDetail | Party agreement content and Odoo blanket order |
| Receiving checklist, inspection report and supplier return authorization | html-print/PDF and labels through Warehouse | ShipmentDetail; QualityInspection; ReturnDetail | Shipment/Return baseline and shared Warehouse outputs |
| Bill, match explanation and supplier statement | html-print/PDF/CSV with allowed financial fields | InvoiceDetail; InvoiceMatch; SupplierStatement | Accounting invoice print/source applications; Dolibarr supplier statement |
| Supplier price and reorder import | CSV mapping/preview/results; Products' proposed ProductImport (PRD-IMPORT) | SupplierPrices; ReorderRules | Products supplier price import; ProductFacility forms |
| Procurement, spend, commitment and scorecard reports | CSV/export and html-print with snapshot/filter metadata | Performance screens | ERPNext buying reports; Odoo purchase analysis |
| External submission receipt | browser/terminal confirmation and authorized email | QuoteResponse; OrderAcknowledgement; SupplierBillUpload | Existing intake receipt conventions; Accounting submission receipt |

Print/email uses the rendered, authorized document revision. A print takes an effective date
and time, read back from the current rows and the audit log, and a key revision stores its PDF
on the record (impl-drawers-commons §4). Download URLs recheck access;
public attachment selection is explicit. Email send is a reviewed user action; automatic
reminders use an explicitly enabled policy. Independent delivery/export items keep named
failures; successful deliveries are not repeated on retry. CSV exports guard spreadsheet
formula-like text. Imports validate decimal quantities, currencies, dates, organization and
supplier identity; each row returns source line number, canonical ID and error, retaining
valid independent rows. Never publish internal quote comparison or competitor data to vendors.

## 16. Framework and data needs

Local IDs below are inputs to the coordinator's crosscut roll-up; shared stock, pricing,
quality, planning, financial and portal needs are defined there once. All new entity, field,
enum and service names below are proposed unless marked built. Framework XML list/split/forms, shell context,
Commons files/Chatter, notifications, calendars and Projects links/intake already exist; no new widget is required
for the initial Purchasing screens.

| Need | Kind | Proposed as | Used by | Stub spec |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PUR-ACCESS | service type, seed data | Purchasing action capabilities and authorized shared adapters (`ironstone.purchasing.AccessServices`); `BOSS_PURCHASING` as root user group and artifact group; the groups `BOSS_PURCHASING_REQUESTER`, `BOSS_PURCHASING_BUYER`, `BOSS_PURCHASING_PLANNER`, `BOSS_PURCHASING_APPROVE`, `BOSS_PURCHASING_READ` and `BOSS_PURCHASING_ADMIN` (§1; D22) | all screens | Per-organization/record/action/field checks for requester, buyer, planner, purchase approver, match operator, receiver, inspector and separate finance roles; shared service access independent of another app root. The groups on `MANTLE_USER_ORG` and `MANTLE_PRIVATE_CONTACT`, `BOSS_PURCHASING_ADMIN` with all authz on the root and `MANTLE_ACTIVE_ORG` (impl-drawers-commons §4). Supplier scope: any Supplier-role party whose owner passes the organization filter, or shared `_NA_`, with no SupplierProfile required (impl-purchasing §4). No artifact authorization for the raw Mantle order, request, agreement and return mutators, their REST paths or `change#OrderPartsStatus`. Borrowed capabilities map to their owner's groups in crosscut §1. |
| PUR-SHELL | shell item, seed data | Buyer providers, a product lookup provider and the NotificationTopic rows `PurchaseRequestApproval`, `PurchaseAwardApproval`, `PurchaseOrderApproval` and `PurchaseSupplierApproval` with their handlers | Home, Approvals, RFQ/PO flows, Product360 | Authorized palette/Today counts; quick create; approval, response, late receipt, match exception topics; each approval topic names `approve#PurchaseSource` and `refuse#PurchaseSource` as its approve and refuse services, and its message carries sourceRevision, policyVersion (the policy row) and decisionStepId; same source revision decision in inbox/local UI; the Approvals mount passes Purchasing's topic list to `get#UserNotifications` (impl-accounting §4). |
| PUR-SUPPLIER | data model, service type, seed data | mantle.party.supplier.SupplierProfile with `selfBillingIndicator` and `approvalStatus`, and SupplierRisk; mantle.party.SupplierServices `store#SupplierProfile` (built, Accounting P6) | Supplier360, Suppliers, Scorecards, Bills | Profile effective-dated rows by supplier and internal organization, key fields audit-logged (impl-drawers-commons §4); currency/settlement/incoterm defaults, dated sourcing block/risk, reason, evidence. The buyer is a dated PartyRelationship from the buyer (Buyer) to the supplier (Supplier), not a profile field; no profile is required to buy from a Supplier-role party in scope (impl-purchasing §4). Default terms and the self-billing flag are finance-edited (D2, D26). Approval status seed Pending, Approved, Rejected, Suspended with the PurchaseSupplierApproval topic (R-PUR-15). Reuse ProductPrice, Party classifications and Products import/resolver. Do not duplicate supplier banking or catalog masters; bank, identification and tax forms are crosscut §3.3's. A SupplierQualifications record would join this family if crosscut's Open item on it (R-XC-46) is accepted. |
| PUR-REQUEST | data model, service type | The request's organization as a RequestParty and a requirement's as a RequirementParty, both in the OrgInternal role; RequestItem.quantityUomId and a cost centre per line; `enable-audit-log` on RequestItem's product, quantity, unit, required date, supplier and cost centre; purchase-aware completion; mantle.request.RequestServices | RequestDetail, RequestSourcing | A request's revision is the time of its last audit-logged item change (impl-purchasing §4); approved source quantity provenance; approval creates or links a Requirement through `RequirementRequestItem` (R-PUR-06); preview/convert#PurchaseSourcing, per-supplier operations/results, transactional RequestItemOrder/RequirementSupply allocation; existing create#PurchaseRequestOrder stays unchanged for CrmMiscServices and BOSS never calls it (impl-purchasing F4), and the guard rejects `placeAndApproveOrders=true` and sourced quantities (R-PUR-01); `get#PurchaseRequestProgress` for crosscut §3.11; `complete#RequestFromWork` does nothing for purchase types; purchase completion uses fulfillment facts. |
| PUR-RFQ | data model, seed data, service type | Proposed RqtPurchaseRfq and its request-type policy; `enable-audit-log` on the RFQ items and on the quote order's supplier reference, validity and terms; each supplier's quote a purchase OrderHeader in OrderRequested and OrderProposed, with its evidence as OrderContent (impl-purchasing §4); mantle.order.SourcingServices (`create#QuoteRequest`, `store#QuoteRequest`, `store#QuoteRequestItem`, `store#QuoteInvitation`, `send#QuoteRequest`, `store#SupplierQuote`, `compare#SupplierQuotes`, `preview#Award`, `commit#Award`, `close#QuoteRequest`, `publish#SupplierQuotePrice`) and BOSS's reads ironstone.purchasing.SourcingServices (`find#QuoteRequests`, `get#QuoteRequest`, `find#SupplierQuotes`, `get#SupplierQuote`) | QuoteRequests through Award | RFQ revisions from the audit log, the published RFQ's PDF as RequestContent; a quote order per invited supplier with its capability and delivery; quote tiers as purchase ProductPrice rows with minimum quantities or a promotion's `isPromo` child items; an award sets the chosen lines' allocations and places the quote orders under lock, per supplier group, and Not awarded cancels the rest; source association RFQ item→RequestItem/Requirement. Quotes are not supply; RequirementSupply is against the placed lines. RFQ requests are excluded from generic request lists and RequestDetail mounts (R-PUR-13). Quote prices publish through Products' `store#ProductPrice` (R-PUR-21). |
| PUR-APPROVAL | data model, service type, seed data | mantle.order.purchase.PurchaseApprovalPolicy (effective-dated rows, key fields audit-logged) and PurchaseApprovalDecision (a record of its own); mantle.order.PurchaseServices (`decide#PurchaseApproval`, `approve#PurchaseSource`, `refuse#PurchaseSource`); SECA `check#PurchaseApprovalRequired` on `check#OrderPreApprove`, behind the buying policy's approval-gate flag | Requests, Award, PO, Agreements, Approvals, Supplier360 | Policy bands/roles/separation by organization and source type; revision-bound decision history keeping the policy row and time, invalidation on an audit-logged key-field change, source state gate and Commons decision handlers that reject a stale revision. Refuse: PO OrderPlaced → OrderRejected, request stays ReqSubmitted, award's quotes stay unplaced, supplier Rejected. Agreement activation on PurchaseOrderApproval with the agreement as source. With no policy, one step by the purchase-approver capability; self-approval only by explicit setting. Where its flag is on, the SECA keeps Mantle's auto-approval from approving a purchase part without a current decision. Nov 1, 2026 (X4): the direction-aware `approve#Order` needs proposed `PURCHASE_ORDER_APPROVE` for a purchase part and runs `check#OrderPreApprove`, so the same SECA guards manual approval; decisions bind to the narrowed commercial `orderRevision` (X2) (D8; R-SB-10; impl-purchasing §4). No duplicate generic approval lifecycle. |
| PUR-ORDER | data model, service type | `enable-audit-log` on `OrderHeader.orderRevision`, OrderItem's unit, cancelled quantity, description and cost centre, and OrderPart's supplier reference and date; proposed acknowledged revision and outcome on OrderPart and a promised date per line, audit-logged (impl-purchasing §4; F17, F18); mantle.order.purchase.ServiceAcceptance (built, Warehouse P16b); mantle.order.OrderServices (`send#PurchaseOrder`, `close#PurchaseRemainders` built by Warehouse P7, `preview#PurchaseRevision`, `apply#PurchaseRevision`, `record#Acknowledgement`, `merge#DraftPurchaseOrders` later); uses Mantle's `hold#Order`, `release#OrderHold` and OrderHoldReason (built, Accounting P10) | OrderDetail, OrderChanges, Acknowledgements, PurchaseOrders | One purchase part per PO; original/requested/confirmed values read back from the audit log, prints as of a date and time, the sent revision's PDF as OrderContent; no revision or acknowledgement record; lock/reapproval through OrderHold with a Purchase or Change reason (D7), per-line supplier promise, changes constrained by posted quantities; idempotent revision publish and per-recipient delivery outcome; remainder close with an explicit cancelQuantity (R-PUR-03); a revision adjusts the expected receipt and queues match re-evaluation. Existing orderRevision and supplier ref fields retained; `increment#OrderRevision` counts only commercial changes behind a CX-AUTOMATION flag, with `get#OrderCommercialSnapshot` as the fallback (X2). |
| PUR-AGREEMENT | data model, seed data, service type | AgrPurchase; Agreement status seed AgmStDraft, AgmStActive, AgmStExpired, AgmStClosed, AgmStCancelled and its transitions, the one Mantle Agreement status flow that Sales also uses (X13); `AgreementItem.amountCap` and `releaseTolerancePercent`, audit-logged with the terms; effective-dated AgreementItems and terms; the release allocation record; mantle.party.AgreementServices | AgreementDetail | Versions from the audit log, the approved agreement's PDF as AgreementContent, signers as AgreementParty rows, activation approved on PurchaseOrderApproval (impl-purchasing §4); explicit blanket/template, quantity/value caps and currency/UOM; purchase lines use existing AitPurchase; atomic source-linked releases refused over cap plus tolerance; expired/cancelled unused portions do not erase fulfilled history; Products price resolver uses agreement match (R-PUR-30). |
| PUR-REORDER | data model, service type | ProductFacility policy fields written through Warehouse's `mantle.facility.FacilityServices.store#ProductFacilityPolicy` (CX-FACILITY-POLICY) and the shared SupplyPlanning schedule `mantle.product.SupplyPlanningServices.store#PlanSchedule` (D20) | ReorderRules, SupplyPlanning | Effective snooze/reason, and `ProductFacility.maximumStock` and `reorderMethodEnumId` (fixed quantity or up to maximum; built, Products P7) read by `run#SupplyPlan`, audit-logged; SuggestLevels from average daily demand × lead time + safety stock (R-PUR-19; impl-purchasing §4); buyer/supplier preference; shared PlanningRun/PlanningSuggestion/RequirementSupply; freshness warnings and current transaction checks. Auto-request default; no separate MRP supply count. No Purchasing-owned planning service. |
| PUR-RECEIPT | service type, data model | Purchasing worklist adapters over shared shipment/quality; `mantle.order.OrderServices.accept#ServiceItem` over `mantle.order.purchase.ServiceAcceptance` (built, Warehouse P16b) | Receipts, Inspections, ShipmentDetail, OrderDetail | find#ExpectedReceipts/find#PurchaseInspections authorized projections; accepted/rejected/held/putaway distinction; Warehouse owns stock posting, `ensure#PurchaseReceipt` and `close#ReceiptRemainder`, and quality owns inspection stages/disposition. Service acceptance records accepted quantity/UOM, date, acceptor and evidence for matching; Manufacturing's `receive#SubcontractOutput` calls it for subcontract lines (R-PUR-09; D14). Maintenance's CompleteWork calls it to accept outside maintenance service with the work's evidence (R-MNT-06). |
| PUR-RETURN | data model, service type | Shared receipt-specific ReturnItem allocation; `mantle.order.ReturnServices.find#ReturnableReceipts` (built by Warehouse P14 with the receipt link, beside `add#ReceiptToReturn`; impl-warehouse §4) and `create#ReplacementOrder`; purchasing list adapter | Returns, ReturnDetail | Source AssetReceipt/lot quantity lock; eligibility = accepted + quarantined − prior supplier returns (R-SB-06); supplier RMA/expiry/instructions; warehouse ShpTpPurchaseReturn and `ship#SupplierReturn`; Accounting `settle#Return` supplier branch with restocking fee line; replacement PO lineage; net eligibility excludes prior returns. |
| PUR-MATCH | data model, service type | Crosscut InvoiceMatch/InvoiceMatchLine/InvoiceHold, InvoiceMatchPolicy (built, Accounting P6, P7), mantle.account.InvoiceMatchServices and BOSS's ironstone.accounting.MatchServices.find#BillExceptions | Bills, MatchExceptions, InvoiceMatch, InvoiceDetail | Accepted receipt remaining quantity lock; apply writes OrderItemBilling (R-SB-18); match policy from Accounting/Settings/MatchPolicies; financial holds by finance and `request#HoldRelease` for buyers; `queue#MatchReevaluation` triggers; receipt bill SECA only for self-billing suppliers with accepted-only billing, behind Accounting's flag (D2); buyers' uploads through `import#Bill`; the legacy match backfill `preview#LegacyMatches` and `apply#LegacyMatches`, mounted in MatchExceptions (impl-accounting §4); no separate Purchasing match model. |
| PUR-BUDGET | data model, service type | Accounting AC-14 BudgetControlPolicy, `mantle.other.budget.BudgetCommitment` and `mantle.other.BudgetServices.check#Budget`, `reserve#Commitment`, `convert#Commitment`, `release#Commitment` (built, Accounting P15; D10) | Request/PO/award approval, OrderChanges, ClosePurchaseOrders, Commitments | Warn/Stop policy, transactional approval commitment keyed by source revision; Purchasing reserves at request approval, converts request to PO at PO approval and releases on cancel or close; Accounting converts PO to actual at payable approval. Purchasing reads/explains, finance owns rule changes. |
| PUR-REPORTS | data model, service type | mantle.party.supplier.SupplierScorecardPolicy/SupplierScorecard/SupplierScorecardMeasure; ironstone.purchasing.ReportServices | Performance | Effective-dated policy rows with audit-logged key fields; each evaluation a record of its own with the policy row it applied; OTD against the first acknowledged date, else the required date, and five eligible receipts by default (impl-purchasing §4); evaluation period, evidence IDs/numerators/denominators, missing-data and effective risk response; authorized spend/commitment/lineage/statements. Optional indexed acceleration exposes freshness; source records remain authority. |
| PUR-SETTINGS | data model, service type, seed data | mantle.order.purchase.PurchasePolicy; `mantle.order.PurchaseServices.store#PurchasePolicy` and ironstone.purchasing.SettingsServices; supplier-category classification type | Settings | Effective-dated organization policy rows with audit-logged key fields, including the approval gate's flag, off by default; typed shared settings and owner links; existing RequestCategory for request purposes/routing; preview impacts before activation. Supplier classification values maintained as PartyClassification rows; terms existing; financial and receiving policies retained at shared owner. |
| PUR-PORTAL | service type, seed data | Purchasing's pages in the PASS Supplier app in mr-pass, which Accounting starts with BillUpload; proposed `mantle.order.SupplierPortalServices` (`get#SupplierHome`, `get#QuoteInvitation`, `save#QuoteResponse`, `submit#QuoteResponse`, `get#PublishedPurchaseOrder`, `acknowledge#PurchaseOrder`) over Mantle's `ExternalAccessServices`, each an operation in PASS's `Schema.js` and `Routes.js`; PASS invitations, media and request contract; Accounting bill intake | SupplierHome, QuoteResponse, OrderAcknowledgement, SupplierBillUpload | Expiring/revocable record+revision capability or a signed-in PASS public account bound to the supplier, with no UserGroup; links are Supplier app pages taking their tokens, the PO's covering acknowledgement and bill upload; local or remote authority through `pass.Facade.call#Operation`; no arbitrary supplier/user parameters; file scope, replay-safe submission and PASS throttling; no Commerce expansion; services hold no token rules of their own (impl-purchasing §4, reversing D5's root). |
| PUR-LATER — Later extensions | service type, data model | Accounting OCR/lease model; shared quality NCR/CAPA; external risk/remote-order protocols | Bills, LeaseOverview, Scorecards | Later dependencies retain owning app/tool; suggested extraction needs confidence and human source matching; externally supplied risk cannot silently approve/block/post; protocol adapters need explicit idempotent outcome/reconciliation. |
| PUR-DROPSHIP | data model, service type, seed data | Moqui Java's `dropship-moqui` branch ported into mr-mantle: facility type `FcTpDropShip`, `Facility.dropShipRemoteId`, the `CustomerShipFrom` and `VendorShipTo` roles, `mantle.order.OrderServices.create#DropShipPurchaseOrder` with its SECA beside `reserve#AssetsForOrder`, `finalize#DropShipPurchaseOrder` and the `send#DropShipPurchaseOrderPart` interface | OrderDetail, PurchaseOrders, RequestSourcing, SupplyPlanning, Supplier360 | A sales line reserved at a supplier-owned drop-ship facility makes a PO cloned from the sales order, `parentOrderId` the sales order and the customer a `CustomerShipTo` OrderPartParty; BOSS's approval gate behind its flag, `send#PurchaseOrder` with no remote, named passed-over lines and a retry answering the first PO; confirmation ships the PO's shipment and packs and ships the sales shipment with its tracking code, so Mantle invoices the customer; the supplier bill matches against the shipped delivery (Accounting's contract); no stock receipt into the buyer's warehouse (impl-purchasing §4, F21; R-PUR-17, R-SB-20). |

## 17. Decided

| Decision | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| RFQ record model (research open question 1) | Purchase-specific proposed RqtPurchaseRfq on Request/RequestItem; each invited supplier's quote is a purchase OrderHeader in OrderRequested and OrderProposed, and an award places it (Supplier quotes as purchase orders, below). Draft PO is usable for direct buying; competitive multi-supplier sourcing is the RFQ Request. Existing RqtQuote remains customer quote semantics. |
| Purchase request granularity (question 2) | Projects owns RequestDetail and generic links/intake. Purchasing mounts purchase context, extends unit-safe items/source completion/approvals and adds a sourcing wizard; no forked purchase case screen. |
| Supplier portal (question 3) | Common external isolation/capability conventions; bounded RFQ response, PO acknowledgement and Accounting bill submission. No separate vendor identity engine or full Commerce design. Decided Oct 28, 2026 (impl-purchasing §4), reversing D5's SupplierPortal root: public-facing pages are in mr-pass and internal ones in mr-boss, so the pages are the PASS Supplier app, which Accounting starts with BillUpload (SupplierBillUpload, once for both apps) and Purchasing extends with SupplierHome, QuoteResponse and OrderAcknowledgement. A supplier contact is a PASS public account with no UserGroup (no `BOSS_SUPPLIER_PORTAL`), invited through a PASS invitation; pages call Mantle's proposed `SupplierPortalServices` through PASS's facade for a local or remote authority; single-record links are Supplier app pages taking their tokens, checked by Mantle's proposed `ExternalAccessServices`, and the PO's link is that app's page for the PO, covering acknowledgement and bill upload, not a `/po/<token>` route. The signed-in accounts and the token links come together on the one capability service, with PASS's throttling and explicit public-file selection; internal on-behalf entry comes first and stays complete (R-PUR-12, R-SB-14; settles the earlier Open item "External supplier access rollout"). |
| Agreement model (question 4) | Existing Agreement/AgreementItem/terms + proposed AgrPurchase and release allocations; versions are the audit log with effective-dated items and terms and the approved PDF stored, and activation is approved on PurchaseOrderApproval with the agreement as source (impl-purchasing §4); ProductPrice agreement linkage/resolver reused. Blanket commitment differs from template and later lease schedule. |
| Approval model (question 5) | Source lifecycle and revision-bound domain policies/decisions, delivered via current Commons notifications. Request Reviewed is not Approved; PO approval, acceptance/match and payable approval are distinct. The topics are PurchaseRequestApproval, PurchaseAwardApproval, PurchaseOrderApproval and PurchaseSupplierApproval, handled by `approve#PurchaseSource` and `refuse#PurchaseSource`; where the buying policy turns its flag on, the SECA `check#PurchaseApprovalRequired` on `check#OrderPreApprove` keeps Mantle's auto-approval from approving a PO without a current decision. With no policy, one purchase-approver step applies (D8; R-PUR-14, R-SB-10). Purchasing's Approvals list passes its topic list to Commons' `get#UserNotifications` (impl-accounting §4). |
| Replenishment versus MRP (question 6) | One shared buy/make/transfer Requirement planning ledger and transactional conversion; buyer filter shows buy defaults but retains cross-source demand provenance. Make conversion creates draft; explicit Manufacturing release is separate. Reorder rules write through Warehouse's proposed `store#ProductFacilityPolicy`; the one plan schedule is SupplyPlanning's proposed `store#PlanSchedule` with `run#SupplyPlan`, replacing the earlier proposed Purchasing `store#ReorderRule` and `store#ReorderSchedule`. Purchasing converts buy suggestions, Manufacturing make and Warehouse transfer (D20; R-XC-09, R-XC-39). |
| Shared record ownership | Product/customer/supplier/order/shipment/invoice/return/quality/planning screens are canonical. Commons owns shell/files/Chatter/approvals/calendar; Projects owns Request/WorkItem. App context never authorizes an action. |
| Stock and financial truth | Receiving, quality disposition, return and financial settlement are separately controlled source facts. Only released accepted quantities qualify under shared match policy; posted corrections reverse/adjust with period checks. |
| Failure boundaries | Independent suppliers, documents, imported rows and deliveries have named partial results; a stock, award allocation or financial posting is atomic and retry-safe. |
| Reference-only features and deliberate deferral | Leases use later Accounting mount; OCR uses later Accounting intake; NCR/CAPA shared quality later; custom pivot/graph/arbitrary score formulas/external risk and remote ordering later through shared tooling. Existing supplier/pricing/request/order/receipt/return/bill forms retain parity coverage; sales promotions and customer-only gateway forms are outside purchase scope. Vendor and product purchase warnings are later, as the crosscut partner-alert Open item (R-XC-45); variant-matrix PO entry is later (PRD-VARIANT-UI); supplier on-time rate beside offers is in OfferComparison (R-PUR-39). |
| Existing automation (D1) | Every Mantle SECA on a Purchasing path is named where the path is designed and goes in the crosscut §1.3 register. `OrderPlacedAutoApprove` is conditioned by `check#PurchaseApprovalRequired` behind the buying policy's flag (§6); each condition has its own flag, off by default (impl-accounting §4). `OrderPlacedSendEmail`, `OrderApprovedSendEmail`, the reservation SECAs and `OrderPlacedAuthorizePayments` are kept; they do nothing for a PO. `OrderApprovedNotify` and `OrderItemWorkEffortCheckComplete` are kept. `ShipmentIncomingDeliveredCreateInvoices` is conditioned to self-billing suppliers (§10). `ReturnApprovedProcess` is kept for the return shipment (§9). |
| Supplier bill creation (D2; R-XC-01, R-SB-01, R-PUR-16) | Settles the earlier Open item "Automatic purchase invoice creation policy". Accounting owns intake through `mantle.account.InvoiceServices.import#Bill` (built, Accounting P6), keyed by organization, supplier and supplier reference; it takes a buyer's upload from Purchasing's Bills as well as AP intake's (decided Oct 28, 2026; impl-purchasing §4, impl-accounting §4). The receipt SECA is off by default and runs only for a supplier flagged self-billing, billing accepted quantity only and keyed by shipmentId; uploads for such a receipt attach to the existing draft. Purchasing's "Create draft bill" uses Accounting's `create#InvoiceFromSource` dialog on OrderDetail and ShipmentDetail, never raw `create#PurchaseShipmentInvoices`. |
| Matching and holds (D4; R-XC-02, R-PUR-08, R-SB-16, R-SB-18, R-SB-19) | The match-operator capability is one Accounting group, `BOSS_ACCOUNTING_MATCH`, which AP includes and which buyers who match bills are given; it applies matches through `InvoiceMatchServices.apply#InvoiceMatch` (built, Accounting P7), which writes OrderItemBilling. Only finance places, releases and approves; buyers request a release through `request#HoldRelease` (BillHoldRelease topic). Match policy lives at `Accounting/Settings/MatchPolicies`; Purchasing shows it read-only. Holds are enforced on every payment path. Re-evaluation is queued by `queue#MatchReevaluation` from receipt, inspection, revision and return events. |
| Order holds and revisions (D7; R-PUR-05, R-SB-07, R-SB-08) | A buyer's PO hold and a revision lock use OrderHold through Mantle's `hold#Order` and `release#OrderHold` (built, Accounting P10), each with an OrderHoldReason (Purchase or Change). A buyer places either under `PURCHASE_ORDER_EDIT`; a Purchase hold is released by a purchase approver under `PURCHASE_HOLD_RELEASE` (X4; crosscut §1.4). A Sent PO un-sends to Approved first. OrderBeingChanged and un-approve are not used. One app's release cannot clear another app's hold. |
| Budget commitments (D10; R-PUR-07, R-XC-37) | Accounting AC-14 owns `BudgetCommitment` and `BudgetServices.check#Budget`, `reserve#Commitment`, `convert#Commitment` and `release#Commitment`. Purchasing reserves at request approval, converts request to PO at PO approval and releases on cancel, close or a reducing revision; Accounting's `approve#Payable` converts PO to actual. The budget item comes from the line's GL account and period; cost center and project are dimensions only if Accounting adds them. |
| Supplier returns (D11; R-SB-05, R-SB-06, R-PUR-23) | Purchasing owns eligibility (`find#ReturnableReceipts`, receipt-based, which Warehouse builds as Purchasing's contract; impl-warehouse §4) and replacements (`create#ReplacementOrder`). Warehouse's `ship#SupplierReturn` sets ReturnShipped. Accounting's `settle#Return` supplier branch creates the supplier credit or debit note, with any restocking fee as a preview line, and completes the return. `receive#ReturnWithoutShipment` is not exposed. |
| Subcontracting (D14; R-PUR-09, R-PUR-22, R-SA-08, R-SA-13) | Purchasing owns the service PO (with OrderItemWorkEffort and RequirementSupply) and `accept#ServiceItem`. Manufacturing's `receive#SubcontractOutput` calls it; the output is never received on the service PO line, and service lines get no receipt-SECA bill. Warehouse dispatches from `Warehouse/Transfers/SubcontractShipmentDetail` to a vendor-custody facility the organization owns. Accounting allocates the charge. |
| Request to PO and covered demand (R-PUR-01, R-PUR-06) | Every "Create purchase order" opens RequestSourcing; nobody calls `create#PurchaseRequestOrder` directly. Approval of a purchase request item creates or links one Requirement through RequirementRequestItem; award and PO lines record RequirementSupply against it, so SupplyPlanning never converts the same demand again. |
| Sending and closing POs (R-PUR-02, R-PUR-03, R-PUR-10, R-SB-11, R-SB-12, R-SB-13) | `send#PurchaseOrder` replaces `send#OrderStoreEmail` for POs. `close#PurchaseRemainders` is the one remainder close, with an explicit cancelQuantity, called by Warehouse's `close#ReceiptRemainder` for short receipts; Warehouse builds it as Purchasing's contract (impl-warehouse §4). Warehouse's `ensure#PurchaseReceipt` keeps one open inbound receipt per PO part, and `adjust#ExpectedReceipt` follows a PO revision. |
| RFQ request type (R-PUR-13) | RqtPurchaseRfq is excluded from generic request lists and RequestDetail mounts; generic triage, work-link completion and Convert to project are off for it, and every open routes to QuoteRequestDetail. |
| Supplier onboarding (R-PUR-15) | SupplierProfile carries a proposed approval status (Pending, Approved, Rejected, Suspended) decided through the PurchaseSupplierApproval topic; an RFQ or PO to a supplier that is not Approved gets the PurchasePolicy Warn or Stop result. |
| Product usability (D19) | RequestSourcing, Award, SupplyPlanning conversion and PO line create call Products' `check#ProductUsable` for buying. |
| Quality hold (D21) | Receipts that need inspection arrive in AstQuarantine through Warehouse's posting guard; the `get#SourceInspectionStatus` feeds matching and planning, and held quantity is excluded from bill matching. Planning nets it as Manufacturing decided (Held quantity in planning, below). |
| Capability vocabulary (D22; R-PUR-24) | §1 maps every capability term of this file to one proposed group; "match operator" is the only name for the matching capability. |
| Supplier finance, identity and tax (D26; R-XC-10) | The shared Supplier360 PaymentDetails (finance-gated; a change voids a pending payment-run approval), PartyIdentifications and TaxRegistrations forms show in Purchasing's mount. Default terms and the self-billing flag stay on SupplierProfile and only finance edits them. |
| Screen names (D27; R-PUR-34) | `Rfqs` is `QuoteRequests`, `RfqDetail` is `QuoteRequestDetail` and `RfqResponse` is `QuoteResponse`, with their forms and proposed services renamed to match (for example `send#QuoteRequest`, `save#QuoteResponse`). Menu titles keep "RFQ", and the proposed Mantle name keeps it (`RqtPurchaseRfq`). |
| Price-screen mounts (R-XC-23) | Purchasing mounts SupplierPrices and PriceExplain only; it opens PriceLists by link with the price-policy grant. |
| Chatter and Files hosts (D25; R-XC-05) | Purchasing's file hosts are Request, OrderHeader, Agreement, Invoice, Shipment and Party (existing content entities) and the proposed ReturnContent for supplier returns. A quote is an OrderHeader, so its evidence is OrderContent; acknowledgement and service-acceptance evidence attaches to the order too (impl-purchasing §4). The scorecard records have no Files. |
| Open items and crosscut §9 (D28; R-XC-15) | Cross-app items that stay open are marked "(also in crosscut §9)" in §18; after impl-purchasing §4 none remain. |
| Shared-screen rows (D28; R-PUR-11, R-PUR-20) | Settled in crosscut §3 on Oct 28, 2026: the §3.6 Purchasing row has the tabs and actions §6 uses; the §3.5 Product360 row adds purchase history and BOM links; the §3.8 ShipmentDetail row adds supplier-return packing and shipping with warehouse authority; the §3.19 QualityInspection row lets holders of those capabilities inspect, verify and dispose; the §3.22 InvoiceMatch row adds `request#HoldRelease`; §4.2 converts buy suggestions to approved purchase requests; and the §3.11 RequestDetail Purchasing row has the Sourcing progress and Approval tabs. |
| Landed costs in the first release (decided Oct 28, 2026; R-PUR-18, R-ACC-10) | Accounting's `Accounting/Payables/LandedCosts` task is in the first release, over proposed `mantle.account.invoice.LandedCostAllocation` and `AssetBookServices.post#LandedCost`. Purchasing InvoiceDetail's "Allocate to receipts" link and Spend's actual landed cost are first-release too. QuoteComparison's landed cost stays an estimate, and Spend labels landed cost as estimated until the allocation posts. |
| Cost centres on purchases (decided Oct 28, 2026; Accounting AC-22) | Each purchase request line names its cost centre (an internal organization Party, such as a department; impl-purchasing §4). `OrderItem.costCenterId` carries it to each PO line and `InvoiceItem.costCenterId` to the bill line (both built, Accounting P6), and posting to `AcctgTransEntry.costCenterId`, with the receipt facility as the facility dimension. A GL account that requires a cost centre refuses a bill line without one, so the buyer sees the gap when creating the draft bill. |
| Research dispositions (R-PUR-33) | Research candidates map per §14.2; the Replenishment shortfall list is merged into SupplyPlanning, InventoryAvailability and ReorderRules. SimpleScreens `Vendor/*` (10 forms) is internal-organization setup handed to Admin and Accounting; Purchasing leaves those inventory cells blank. Mantle's `OrderAutoReorder` status is not used; automatic conversion creates OrderOpen drafts. Scorecards do not write `ProductPrice.supplierRatingTypeEnumId`; it stays a recorded datum on the price row (Products). |
| Root group and organization filters (decided Oct 28, 2026; impl-purchasing §4) | As in Products, `BOSS_PURCHASING` is the root user group and the artifact group, with service checks. The Purchasing groups take `MANTLE_USER_ORG` and `MANTLE_PRIVATE_CONTACT`; `BOSS_PURCHASING_ADMIN`, with all authz on the root, takes `MANTLE_ACTIVE_ORG` and `MANTLE_PRIVATE_CONTACT` (impl-drawers-commons §4). A buyer may work with any Supplier-role party whose owner passes the active or available organization filter, or shared `_NA_`; no SupplierProfile is required. |
| Supplier quotes as purchase orders (decided Oct 28, 2026; impl-purchasing §4, F19) | A supplier's quote is a purchase OrderHeader in OrderRequested ("Request Quote") and OrderProposed ("Propose Quote"), with validity, terms and supplier reference on OrderPart and evidence as OrderContent; an award sets the chosen lines' allocations and places it ("Place from Quote"), and Not awarded cancels the rest. The earlier proposed PurchaseRfqInvitation, SupplierQuote, SupplierQuoteItem, SupplierQuotePriceBreak, SupplierQuoteContent and PurchaseAward are dropped. |
| Revisions, prints and effective-dated policies (decided Oct 28, 2026; impl-purchasing §4; impl-drawers-commons §4) | Revisions are audit-logged key fields with `OrderHeader.orderRevision` and its time; a request's or RFQ's revision is the time of its last audit-logged change, and an agreement's its audit-logged `agreementRevision` counter and its time (impl-purchasing F-P13-1). OrderDetail, OrderChanges, QuoteDetail, RequestDetail and AgreementDetail show the history from the audit log, and their prints take an effective date and time. A sent PO, a published RFQ and an approved agreement store their PDFs as OrderContent, RequestContent and AgreementContent. An acknowledgement is audit-logged OrderPart and line fields. The earlier proposed PurchaseOrderRevision and PurchaseAcknowledgement are dropped. SupplierProfile, PurchasePolicy, PurchaseApprovalPolicy and SupplierScorecardPolicy are effective-dated rows with audit-logged key fields, and a document keeps the policy row it was evaluated against, and the time. An approval decision, a scorecard evaluation and an agreement release allocation stay records of their own. |
| Parties by role (decided Oct 28, 2026; impl-purchasing §4) | A request's organization is a RequestParty in the OrgInternal role, a requirement's a RequirementParty, and the cost centre is on each line; a supplier's buyer is a dated PartyRelationship from the buyer (Buyer) to the supplier (Supplier); a drop-ship customer is the PO part's `CustomerShipTo` OrderPartParty; agreement signers are AgreementParty rows. The fields Mantle keys by stay: OrderPart's vendor and customer, Request's filer, Agreement's two parties. |
| One purchase part and internal entry first (decided Oct 28, 2026; impl-purchasing §4, F7) | A PO has one purchase part, and revisions, sends and acknowledgements key on the order header's revision. Buyers enter quotes and acknowledgements on the supplier's behalf before the supplier pages exist. |
| Drop-ship (decided Oct 28, 2026; impl-purchasing §4, F21; R-PUR-17, R-SB-20) | Settles the earlier Open item "Drop-ship purchase orders". Drop-ship POs are built, the way Moqui Java's unmerged `dropship-moqui` branch does it, ported into mr-mantle: a supplier-owned `FcTpDropShip` facility, the sales line reserved there, `create#DropShipPurchaseOrder` cloning the sales order into a PO whose `parentOrderId` is the sales order with the customer as `CustomerShipTo`, and `finalize#DropShipPurchaseOrder` shipping the PO's and the sales order's shipments, so Mantle's pack SECA invoices the customer. BOSS adds its approval gate, named results and the email send (§6 Drop-ship). ShpTpDrop and the earlier proposed `confirm#DropShipDelivery`, with its two InvoiceFromSource calls, are not used. |
| Quote quantity tiers (decided Oct 28, 2026; impl-purchasing §4, F22) | Both ways: purchase ProductPrice rows with minimum quantities, priced by the resolver and written by `publish#SupplierQuotePrice`; and, where an organization uses it, a promotion's auto-adjust adding an `isPromo` child OrderItem for the quantity difference (§5 QuoteDetail). |
| Approval thresholds and roles (decided Oct 28, 2026; impl-purchasing §4) | Settles the earlier Open item. No monetary auto-approval outside explicitly configured policy; a buyer and manager split to start, with a visible Warn budget policy and finance choosing Stop per budget. With no active policy, one step by the purchase-approver capability approves, and self-approval needs an explicit setting (R-PUR-14). |
| Performance date basis and sample (decided Oct 28, 2026; impl-purchasing §4) | Settles the earlier Open item. OTD measures against the first supplier-acknowledged line date, else `OrderItem.requiredByDate`, with the latest promise shown separately, counting receipt events per line; five eligible receipts is the ScorePolicy default minimum before a weighted score can drive a block, editable per policy (§11). |
| Legacy PO and receipt match backfill (decided Oct 28, 2026; impl-purchasing §4, impl-accounting §4) | Settles the earlier Open item. Accounting's `preview#LegacyMatches` and `apply#LegacyMatches`, run by AP or a buyer with the match group from either app, Purchasing's MatchExceptions included: links only from unambiguous OrderItemBilling and AssetReceipt evidence, each ambiguous line named as a match exception, and no unexplained balance matched (§10). |
| Maximum stock and suggested levels (decided Oct 28, 2026; impl-purchasing §4) | Settles the earlier Open item. `ProductFacility.maximumStock` and `reorderMethodEnumId` (built, Products P7) through `store#ProductFacilityPolicy`, read by `run#SupplyPlan`, and SuggestLevels on ReorderRules (§8; R-PUR-19). |
| Supply planning and held quantity (decided Oct 28, 2026; impl-purchasing §4, impl-manufacturing §4) | Manufacturing builds CX-PLANNING with SupplyPlanning, the make conversion and the outside-processing service PO lines for `BOSS_PURCHASING_BUYER`; Purchasing adds its mount and the buy conversion. Settling the earlier Open item on held quantity: a receipt held for inspection is a pending-release line with the inspection's due date, left out of netting by default, and the plan schedule's organization option nets held quantity whose inspection is due within the lead time (D21; R-SA-17). |
| One Agreement status flow (Nov 1, 2026; review X13, R-SAL-05) | The PUR-AGREEMENT seed (AgmStDraft, AgmStActive, AgmStExpired, AgmStClosed, AgmStCancelled and their transitions) is the one Mantle Agreement status flow; Sales adopts it. The purchase and customer AgreementDetail screens stay two, by design, and may share forms. |
| Approval binds to the commercial revision (Nov 1, 2026; review X2, R-SAL-02) | PurchaseApprovalDecision, the sent revision, the acknowledgement and the Supplier capability bind to `orderRevision` narrowed to commercial changes, the same counter as Sales quotes and Customer Service's ChangeProposal; the flags are built (`PurchasePolicy.commercialRevisionOnly`; for a sales order the seller's `PartyAcctgPreference.salesCommercialRevisionOnly`), so no `get#OrderCommercialSnapshot` fallback is needed (impl-sales F9). |
| Direction-aware approval (Nov 1, 2026; review X4, R-SAL-04) | Manual `approve#Order` needs `PURCHASE_ORDER_APPROVE` for a purchase part and, behind the buying organization's approval gate, a current approval decision: as built it refuses on the same purchase-approval warning that the D8 SECA adds to `check#OrderPreApprove`, which `autoApprove#Order` runs and refuses on, so the D8 rule guards manual approval too (crosscut §1.4); OhtPurchase is released with proposed `PURCHASE_HOLD_RELEASE`, and `ORDER_APPROVE` no longer releases it. |
| Maintenance outside service (Nov 1, 2026; review R-MNT-06) | `OrderServices.accept#ServiceItem` accepts outside maintenance service from Maintenance's CompleteWork; RequestDetail shows the originating work order; `link#MaintenancePurchase` writes `AssetMaintenanceOrderItem`. |

## 18. Open

| Review item | Recommended answer | Effect until confirmed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Advanced purchasing integrations and analytics | Defer EDI/remote supplier ordering, arbitrary scoring formulas and automatic third-party risk blocks; preserve typed connector/outcome hooks and source evidence. Inbound electronic bills arrive through Accounting's AC-15 intake, not a Purchasing adapter. | No claim of those protocols being implemented; normal email/PDF/PASS supplier page/CSV processes cover the core design. |
| Vendor-owned consignment stock | Recommend `later`: consignment receipts carry `Asset.ownerPartyId` = the supplier, and consumption triggers the PO and bill (R-PUR-38). | Only company-owned stock in supplier custody is designed (subcontracting). |
