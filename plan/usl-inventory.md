# mr-mantle service inventory

Per-service inventory of the mr-mantle component, for tracking service-level feature parity in IronStone BOSS.

- Source: `runtime/component/mr-mantle/service/` (current working tree).
- Service: every `<service>` element in the service definition XML files under `service/mantle/` (including `GeneralServices.xml`).
- Test services (`PaymentTestServices.xml`, `OrderTestServices.xml`), service ECAs (`*.secas.xml`), and the REST API definition (`mantle.rest.xml`) are excluded.
- The **Designed in** column is filled when a design file is reviewed with the IronStone screen path(s) whose form summaries call the service (blank when no screen calls it); the **Implemented in** column is filled during implementation with the screens that call it. See [design-doc-guide.md](design-doc-guide.md) §9.
- **Implemented in** was filled on Oct 19, 2026 from the drawers-commons build (the Commons, Comms, `Shared`, `PublicShare` and `Unsubscribe` screens): each screen whose transitions, actions or forms call the service, directly or through the `ironstone.*` services of `service/ironstone/` (followed from one to the next, but not into Mantle's own calls, so `save#*ContentFile`, which `create#*Content` calls, stays blank). A screen that includes a `template/` record (ContactRecord, ConsentRecord) has that record's calls, so the contact record's are on both `Commons/Contacts/ContactDetail` and `Commons/Contacts/List`; a `.qvue` screen goes by its `.xml` path; a service the shell calls through a BOSS theme value names the value, and `Unsubscribe` includes its token route's check. The other apps' screens from the first port (Sales/Reports, Projects/Timesheets) are not counted.
- **Added** tables, at the end of Party, Request and Work and as the Marketing section: the services Mantle gained during that build that a built screen calls (102 of the 143 new ones; the rest are not listed yet).
- **Implemented in** of the design gaps closed on Oct 19, 2026 (Chatter edit and delete, the contact info card, EventDetail's linked records, the Account photo, Duplicate page): `update#RequestComment` and `delete#RequestComment` are reached from Chatter through Mantle's `update#RecordNote` and `delete#RecordNote` for a note on a request, and are filled with `Shared/Chatter`, which edits and deletes notes on every record (the Commons hosts, RequestDetail among them). Their **Designed in** is blank until design-drawers-commons, which names most of them in its form summaries and §19, is reviewed again.
- **Designed in** for [design-projects.md](design-projects.md) was filled on Oct 21, 2026 from the Mantle services its screen sections name (the form summaries, the actions and the Context passed blocks), each screen by the path the design gives it, after what an earlier design wrote; the `Projects` root calls `setup#UserOrganizationInfo` as the Commons and Comms roots do. Services the design names as new are not rows until Mantle has them. The 17 services of `work/GitServices.xml`, added to Mantle on Oct 20, joined the Work table (no BOSS screen calls them yet), and `link#RequestRecord` and `unlink#RequestRecord`, added after the drawers-commons save point, joined Request's Added table with the Commons screens that call them.
- **Implemented in** for [design-projects.md](design-projects.md) was filled on Oct 22, 2026 at the end of the Projects build (impl-projects.md P11), as the drawers-commons pass was: each Projects screen whose transitions, actions or forms call the service, directly or through the `ironstone.*` services (followed from one to the next, not into Mantle's own calls), after what Commons wrote. A `.qvue` screen and its terminal twin go by the `.xml` path (`Projects/Time/MyTime` for MyTimeTui too); the shared screens by their Projects mount (`Projects/WorkItems/WorkItemDetail`, `Projects/Requests/RequestDetail`, `Projects/Billing/InvoiceDetail`, `Projects/Billing/OrderDetail`); Commons' Knowledge and KnowledgeTui by the Docs tab (`Projects/Projects/ProjectDetail/Docs`); the root's always-actions as `Projects`; the public request form as `RequestIntake`. A service reached from more than twelve Projects screens (the visibility and settings reads behind the access and find services) is written as a count. 68 rows filled; the **Added in the Projects build** tables at the end of Account, Party, Request and Work hold the 112 services Mantle gained in P1–P10 that a built screen calls (their **Designed in** is blank: the design names them as new, §15).
- **Designed in** for the six core app drafts and [design-crosscut.md](design-crosscut.md) was extended on Oct 27, 2026 from their form/service coverage review. New mappings are additive to Commons and Projects; **Implemented in** is unchanged. Proposed services and definitions inside XML comments are not counted as active existing services.
- **Designed in** for the six core designs and [design-crosscut.md](design-crosscut.md) was updated on Oct 28, 2026 after their review ([review-core-apps.md](review-core-apps.md)). Paths of renamed or moved screens are replaced in place. Entries were added for existing services the reviewed designs now call from a screen (the Manufacturing MaterialIssueReceipt mount, Downtime and NewWorkOrder; Warehouse SupplierReturnShipment and Ship; Accounting InventoryValuation and SalesAnalysis; the OrderDetail approve guard's `check#OrderPreApprove`; Products VariantBuilder). `modify#ProductPrice` no longer lists SupplierPrices: it is the price resolver's modifier interface, and writes go through the proposed `store#ProductPrice` (R-PUR-04). Services that only rules or other services call (`create#PurchaseShipmentInvoices`, `create#ProductionRun`, `reserve#IncreasedAsset`, `post#AssetReceipt`, and similar) stay blank. **Implemented in** is unchanged.

- **PASS design follow-up (Oct 27, 2026):** [design-forum.md](../../mr-pass/plan/design-forum.md) adds `PASS:`-prefixed contexts for existing Mailbox/Communication services used through the proposed public facade and shared-policy extensions. Implemented in is unchanged. Proposed PASS services and future Commerce/Publishing screens are not inventory claims.

Added in Accounting P5 for gateway actions, called by built screens. They review and confirm Mantle's

### Products implementation, Oct 29, 2026

Products uses native guarded replacements for raw catalog writes, bulk assignments, content revisions and variant previews. Legacy service rows above stay blank where no BOSS screen calls that legacy API; a Designed in entry alone is not an implementation claim. Other apps' shared mounts remain later. The following public native entry points are reached by built Products screens; internal per-row workers and calls made only by another Mantle service are not claimed here.

## Accounting native additions — P0–P3 (Oct 29, 2026)

The screens call these native services after BOSS access context. Reviewed posting replaces raw/unrestricted ledger
mutators in the app. Legacy unpost, posted rewrite and post#GlJournal remain unexposed.
