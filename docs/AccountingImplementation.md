# Accounting implementation

The Accounting app calls Mantle's services, which check permissions and organization scope themselves. BOSS owns
its access context, routes, choices, Home and forms, and adds no financial pass-through service. Later workflow
sections are hidden until their destinations exist. P0–P5 and P14 (tax) are built; P4–P5 were reviewed and rebuilt on
Mantle's services (R2 in [impl-accounting](../plan/impl-accounting.md)). Payable intake is P6, close execution P11, activation
P19, and foreign-currency posting and rate refresh P20.

## Routes and users

| Area | Implemented destinations |
| --- | --- |
| Foundation | Home; Receivables/Invoices and InvoiceDetail; Payables/Bills and BillDetail; Payments/Payments and PaymentDetail; QuickCreate/NewInvoice, NewBill, NewPayment and NewEntry |
| Receivables | Invoices, one list with list and calendar views; shared InvoiceDetail with ten tabs; BillingQueue; InvoiceBatch; Statements and StatementPrint; InvoicePrint; shared Customer360 Contact, Orders, Money, Agreements, FinanceDetails and Files |
| Settlement and payments | ReceivablesWorkbench; Payments with new payment and internal transfer; PaymentDetail Overview, Applications, Gateway, Refunds, GeneralLedger, Files and History; GatewayTransactions; PaymentPrint for the receipt, detail and check (a transfer's detail only) |
| Ledger | GeneralLedger/ChartOfAccounts, AccountDetail, JournalEntries, JournalEntryDetail, TransactionEntries, JournalBatches and JournalTemplates |
| Periods | PeriodClose/Periods and PeriodLocks |
| Reports | Reports/Reports, TrialBalance and GeneralLedger |
| Settings | Settings/Settings, AccountingPreferences, PostingDefaults, PaymentTerms, Currencies, PaymentMethods and DocumentSettings |
| Tax | Tax/TaxAuthorities, TaxRates (with the simulation), TaxStatements and TaxStatementDetail, for the tax group and finance administrators |

All routes are under `/qapps/Accounting`. Record routes take `recordId`; reads, mutations, search choices, exports,
record links and files validate their organizations and records on the server. Report navigation and print URLs
retain organization, date/period, currency and dimension filters. Mantle's record reads return display text: dates in
the user's zone (`AccountingPolicy.display`), party, status and counterparty names, and a document's date, amount and
currency. Shared screen parts are in `template/AccountingParts.xml` (choices, the organization picker, find, batch
review, report options) and `template/AccountingDocuments.xml` (the invoice, bill and payment list, detail and draft).

Demo users are `finance.ar`, `finance.ap`, `finance.match`, `finance.treasury`, `finance.gl`, `finance.tax`,
`finance.read`, `finance.approve` and `finance.admin` (demo password `moqui`). The reader has no other business
launcher. Reads come from view permissions: `ACCOUNTING_VIEW` for every kind, `RECEIVABLE_VIEW`, `PAYABLE_VIEW` and
`PAYMENT_VIEW` for their kinds. An edit permission alone opens no reads, so Projects' managers, who hold
`RECEIVABLE_EDIT` for billing, do not read Accounting's records. Their composed grants are in BossAccountingSetupData; no finance role gets GL_POST_CLOSED, raw REST
mutation authorization, unpost, unrestricted posted rewrites or bulk historical repost authorization. Organization
membership follows Mantle's existing direct-child organization rule; active scope narrows it. Administration can
select an internal organization, and private-contact filters still apply.

Deterministic fixtures use BOSS_ACCT_ORG and BOSS_ACCT_INVOICE/BILL/PAYMENT/ENTRY/POSTED. BOSS_ACCT_ORG is the demo's
own organization (BossAccountingUsersDemoData), outside the Ziziwork rollup, with Mantle's default accounting
configuration; it explicitly enables the guard, required dimensions and forward issuance adjustment, so the adoption does
not reach Mantle's demo flows, which post directly for ORG_ZIZI_RETAIL and ORG_ZIZI_CORP. Native defaults remain N.
A demo item and unassigned expense account support the setup repair walk; the revaluation offset maps to
BOSS_INVENTORY_REVALUATION.

## Native contracts

| Native service family | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| AccountingServices / AccountingPolicy | Capabilities, scope, record and child checks, safe account projections, lists, draft documents |
| JournalServices | Draft headers/lines, genuine draft-line moves, description-only posted correction with reason, previews, reviewed posting/reversal, independent batches and versioned templates |
| LedgerServices / PostingGuard | Native posting choke point, organization/source/account/date/currency/balance checks, fiscal parents, typed locks, required/supplied dimensions and operation identity |
| CloseServices | Audited organization lock dates; named user/group, scope, transaction and expiry exceptions to a specific soft lock |
| AccountServices | Account metadata, assignments/dates/dimension requirements, classifications and fiscal-period generation |
| FinanceReportServices | Currency-separated trial balance/ledger, stored closed-period summaries, live open-period entries and comparison calculations |
| SetupServices | Readiness, posted-basis protection, mapping validation/repair, clone conflict preview/concurrency, due terms and masked method metadata |
| CurrencyServices | Explicit dated manual rates and independent CSV rows with persisted source/import results |
| JournalContentServices | Authorized journal evidence upload and RecordFiles ownership |
| InvoiceServices / InvoiceWorkflow | `change#InvoiceState`, draft edits, approved-time billing, linked credits (`create#InvoiceCreditMemo`, `apply#InvoiceCredit`), the receivables list and summary, print (`get#InvoiceOutput` over `get#InvoicePrintInfo`), `send#Invoice` through an EmailTemplate, batches |
| CollectionServices | `get#Statements` and `send#Statements` over `get#ReceivableStatementInfo` |
| CustomerFinanceServices | The customer's finance context through the existing contact, order and receivable services; masked methods for treasury |
| TaxServices (mantle.other) | Rate versions and authorities (`store#Rate`, `store#Authority`), the local gateway and an invoice's tax lines at finalize, the simulation, sales tax statements, the 1099 run and the CSV export |
| PaymentServices | Open items and settlement through the `apply#*` services; payment lists, detail, drafts, state changes through `update#Payment` and unapplication; issued documents; gateway actions through the `*#SinglePayment` services; refunds through `create#RefundPayment`; internal transfers. Each confirmed review is a `PaymentReview` row |

New financial services check permissions and organization scope even when artifact authorization is disabled.
Journal previews expire after ten minutes; their fingerprints include authoritative source headers, transaction and
lines, accounts/assignments, relevant configuration, periods, locks and exceptions. Posting rechecks under lock.
External operation keys are at most 40 characters, matching the existing PostingOperation schema; internal batch
and source keys are deterministic bounded hashes. Identical retries return the recorded result; changed reuse is
refused. A reversal links its original only after successful posting, and a failed reversal rolls back atomically.

`verifyOnly` performs reads only: no period creation, transaction updates, summary updates or operation records.
Direct financial failures are refused with stable reason codes and preview findings. Adopted operational stock and
financial-account failures stay unposted in the configured error journal with a recorded failure; missing mappings
never produce AtrSuccess. Legacy callers keep their defaults. Forward issuance adjustments are opt-in and preserve
historical posted movements, including dates already protected by a hard lock.

Each batch transaction validates and posts in its own transaction. Named failures do not stop independent items;
partially successful batches remain open. Published template versions are immutable, and an effective publication
instantiates an independent draft with its source version. Required dimensions are per organization/account;
supplied facilities and cost centres are checked even when they are optional. New journal, template and draft payment amounts round to their currency.

## Configuration boundaries

PostingDefaults covers account assignments, GL types, item types/directions, invoice types, payment types,
instruments, asset/type/class, financial account type/reason, variance, product, category and party defaults. For
invoice product lines the existing resolver checks category, product and asset-type profit/receipt accounts before
item defaults. Organization configuration includes its accounting parents. Missing generic item defaults are
identified using that resolver, alongside missing GL types and the scoped error journal. ChartOfAccounts can
assign an existing global chart account; account reads never include another organization's balances.

Preferences and clone application refuse routine changes to the currency, fiscal or costing basis of posted
history. Clone previews preserve destination conflicts, name mappings incompatible with the destination, and reject stale inputs. Mantle's invoice/order numbering
fields remain authoritative; issued identities are not rewritten. Terms are due-only. Currency rates are dated,
positive and source-labelled; malformed independent CSV rows are retained as failures while valid rows commit.

PaymentGatewayOrganization records are provisioned outside finance forms in Admin. Only active organization
bindings are offered for a new method binding. Finance sees gateway IDs/descriptions and masked identifiers, never
credentials or executable service names. The demo organization permits TEST_APPROVE and TEST_DECLINE. Approved
standard document layouts have representative long previews; the shared HTML viewer retains its script sandbox.
Mantle's test gateway (`PaymentTestServices.xml`) answers pending and declined, and the demo's gateway uses it. PASS
runtime changes remain P18, as documented in mr-pass/design-forum.

## Receivables and payments

Screens call Mantle's receivables and payment services after `ironstone.accounting.AccessServices` has checked the
capability and the organization ([mr-mantle AccountingImplementation](../../mr-mantle/docs/AccountingImplementation.md)
has the contracts). Mantle decides every financial question; BOSS shapes its answers for a screen.

- **Screen services.** `ReceivableServices.xml` (with `Receivables.js`) serves the receivables screens, and
  `PaymentScreenServices.xml` and `SettlementScreenServices.xml` (with `Payments.js` and `Settlements.js`) the payment
  and settlement screens: their options, names, capabilities and review rows. The payment and settlement transitions
  call these declared services, not module functions. `AccountingLib.js` holds what the modules share: the access check and app root,
  reviewed `id~version` tokens, paging names, record links and parameters, operation keys and the before and after rows
  of a review.
- **Receivables.** Each InvoiceDetail tab holds its own section and includes only the transitions its forms post to.
  The header follows ProjectDetail: a status chip with its tui twin, print and PDF through `sharedLinks`, one send
  dialog. Invoices is one list with list and calendar views. Statements show `get#Statements`. DocumentSettings'
  preview renders Mantle's invoice print template over a sample. Customer360's finance transitions are in its
  FinanceDetails tab only.
- **Projects.** Billing's invoice services are inline XML Actions over Mantle's; its `send#Invoice` passes its
  time-detail print to Mantle's `send#Invoice` (`printLocation`), so the emailed PDF keeps the time detail.
- **Settlement.** ReceivablesWorkbench keeps its selection in Mantle behind a `draftId` (`store#`/`get#SettlementDraft`)
  and confirms a review by its id, fingerprint and the operation key Mantle's preview returned.
- **Payments.** The detail's dialogs review and confirm through Mantle's preview and confirm services: state changes,
  unapplication, gateway actions, manual refunds and transfers. GatewayTransactions lists PaymentGatewayResponse rows.
  Payment files are read and locked through Mantle (`get#PaymentAccess`), and the shared Files screens ask
  `get#RecordContentPolicy` what a record's files allow. The transfer form names who is paid the fee.
- **Settings and demo.** AccountingPreferences shows the posting guard (`postingGuardEnabled`), required dimensions
  and forward issuance adjustment. The demo service turns them on for BOSS_ACCT_ORG only, with the single-currency
  refusal (`singleCurrencyDocumentsOnly`), and its gateway uses Mantle's test gateway services.

## Tax

`TaxServices.xml` with `Tax.js` serves the Tax screens' reads (authorities with the organization's nexus, registration,
account and current rates; rate versions with their state; statements; a statement's detail with its lines over
`find#SalesTaxLines`) after the tax capability (`taxEdit` or `admin`). Writes go to Mantle's TaxServices; Tax's delete
checks the capability and the statement's organization before `delete#TaxStatement`. The choices `taxGeos`, `stores`,
`taxPeriods` (the organization's fiscal periods that have begun, latest first) and `enum:TaxAuthorityType` are in
`Accounting.js`. The Tax area authorizes BOSS_ACCOUNTING_TAX and BOSS_ACCOUNTING_ADMIN only. The demo
(`Demo.js` `taxDocuments`, in `load#AccountingDemo`) gives BOSS_ACCT_ORG Utah sales tax at 6.1% with nexus, the
LOCAL gateway, Sales Tax Collected as the authority's account, the taxed invoice BOSS_ACCT_TAXED to Wasatch Outfitters,
and two IRS-registered suppliers paid this year, one without a taxpayer number.

## Verification

Tests run through Moqui's JavaScript runners; Node is not a test dependency.

- Server specs: AccountingAccess, AccountingIsolation and AccountingShell (roles, scope and the palette, with paired
  positive and negative cases), AccountingScreens, AccountingReceivables, AccountingSettlement, AccountingPayments,
  AccountingPaymentFiles, AccountingIssuedFiles, AccountingPaymentGateway, AccountingPaymentRefunds,
  AccountingPaymentTransfers and AccountingTax; Projects' Billing and ClientBilling. AppStructure and TuiRender render every Accounting
  screen in qvt and tui.
- Browser walks, one live-client pass each: ledger, settings, receivables, settlement, payments, gateway and tax.
- Screen lint writes to a report file; a screen source is never its output.

```sh
./moq test --nobuild mr-mantle
./moq test --nobuild mr-boss
./moq test --nobuild mr-boss --spec AccountingReceivables,AccountingSettlement,AccountingPayments,AccountingPaymentGateway,AccountingPaymentRefunds,AccountingPaymentTransfers
./moq test-client --nobuild mr-boss --serve --spec AccountingLedgerWalk,AccountingSettingsWalk,AccountingReceivablesWalk,AccountingSettlementWalk,AccountingPaymentsWalk,AccountingPaymentGatewayWalk,AccountingTaxWalk
target/develop/moqui lint --screens <report-file>
```

The PDF specs need a Chromium for PDF (`pdf_chromium_path`; see [Run-Deploy](../../../../docs/Run-Deploy.md) and
[Client-Testing](../../../../docs/dev/Client-Testing.md)); without one every PDF spec fails. The BOSS demo adopts the
controls only on BOSS_ACCT_ORG, so Mantle's low-level posting specs run in the same runtime as Accounting's and test
Mantle's defaults. Results are recorded in [impl-accounting](../plan/impl-accounting.md).

Each walk checks only what needs the live client: that its dialogs and forms post to their transitions, that a review
survives a reload, and that a saved result is checked again without a second write. The ledger and settings walks
post a balanced journal, assign an existing expense account, repair an invoice item default, create a due term,
import valid and invalid rate rows, and save numbering preferences; the others create, finalize and send an invoice,
apply a receipt and credit, deliver a manual payment, and authorize then capture through the gateway; the tax walk
versions a rate and simulates a sale, finalizes a taxed product invoice, and makes a sales tax statement and the year's
1099 data. The financial
rules, permissions and refusals are tested in the server specs here and in mr-mantle. Keep deterministic fixtures
declared in the data file: the client runner's snapshot key includes entity and data files and the binary, not
service implementation text.

The remote-choice widget keeps a selected value when its parent form rerenders and a later search page leaves the
selected row out; a dependency change still clears it. QvtKeys has a browser regression for it.
